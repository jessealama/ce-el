<h1>Discourse Representation Theory</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue May 22, 2007; substantive revision Tue Jul 26, 2011</em></div>

<p>

In the early 1980s, Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) was
introduced by Hans Kamp as a theoretical framework for dealing with
issues in the semantics and pragmatics of anaphora and tense (Kamp
1981); a very similar theory  was
developed independently by Irene Heim (1982). The distinctive features
of DRT, to be discussed below, are that it is a mentalist and
representationalist theory of interpretation, and that it is a theory
of the interpretation not only of individual sentences but of
discourse, as well. In these respects DRT made a clear break with
classical formal semantics, which during the 1970s had emanated from
Montague&apos;s pioneering work (Thomason 1974), but in other respects it
continued the tradition, e.g. in its use of model-theoretical
tools. In the meantime, DRT has come to serve as a framework for
explaining a wide range of phenomena, but we will confine our
attention to three: anaphora, presupposition, and tense. For
references to work on other topics, see the
&ldquo;Further reading&rdquo;

<h2><a name="Int">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>

This article concerns Discourse Representation Theory narrowly defined
as work in the tradition descending from Kamp (1981). The same term is
sometimes used more broadly, occasionally embracing Heim&apos;s work
(&ldquo;File Change Semantics&rdquo;,
FCS) and
the developments in Dynamic Semantics (DS) initiated by Groenendijk
and Stokhof (1991). The term DRT is not typically used for
Fauconnier&apos;s (1984, 1985) Mental Spaces (MS) model, though his work
shares strong commonalities with that of both Heim and Kamp. The
differences between DRT (narrowly defined) and the various related
theories we have mentioned are summarized in Table 1.</p>

<p>

DRT&apos;s main (and most controversial) innovation, beyond the Montagovian
paradigm which was then considered orthodox, is that it introduced a
level of mental representations, called discourse representation
structures (DRSs). The basic idea is rather straightforward. It is
that a hearer builds up a mental representation of the discourse as it
unfolds, and that every incoming sentence prompts additions to that
representation. This picture has always been commonplace in the
psychology of language. DRT&apos;s principal tenet is that it should be the
starting point for semantic theory, too.</p>

<p>

A theory of the DRT family consists of the following ingredients:</p>

<ul>
 <li> A formal definition of the representation language, consisting of:
   <ul>
   <li> a recursive definition of the set of all well-formed DRSs,
and </li>
   <li> a model-theoretic semantics for the members of this set; </li>
   </ul>
   </li>
 <li> a construction procedure, which specifies how to extend a given
DRS when a sentence comes in. </li>
</ul>

<p>

Technically, this is very similar to earlier work in formal semantics,
with two exceptions: the interpretation process always takes the
previous discourse into account, and the level of semantic
representations is claimed to be essential. What has worried
semanticists is not so much the fact that DRSs are mental
representations, but that an additional level is needed; we will
return to this point in Section 6.</p>

<h2><a name="DonPro">2. Donkey pronouns</a></h2>

<p>

The relationship between a pronoun and its antecedent is one that has
received a great deal of attention in linguistics and philosophy.  We
say that a pronoun is anaphoric, as opposed to deictic, for example,
if it depends for its interpretation on an antecedent expression
elsewhere in the sentence or the discourse. In some cases the nature
of this dependency seems straightforward:</p>

<blockquote>

<table cellspacing="+2" cellpadding="+2">
<tbody>
 <tr>
  <td valign="top">[1]</td>
  <td valign="top"><u>Pedro</u> beats <u>his</u> donkey.</td>
 </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

(Here and henceforth we use underlining to highlight the anaphoric
links we are currently interested in.) Since &ldquo;Pedro&rdquo; is a
referential
expression, it makes sense, in this case, to say that
&ldquo;his&rdquo; is a
referential term, too, which derives its reference from its
antecedent.  This construal is plausible enough, but it doesn&apos;t apply
across the board:</p>

<blockquote>

<table cellspacing="+2" cellpadding="+2">
 <tr>
  <td valign="top">[2]</td>
  <td valign="top"><u>No farmer</u> beats <u>his</u> donkey.</td>
 </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

The term &ldquo;no farmer&rdquo; is not a referential expression, so
&ldquo;his&rdquo; cannot be coreferential with it. Rather, it would
seem that, in this case, the relationship between the pronoun and its
antecedent is one of <strong>binding</strong>, in the logical sense of
the word: &ldquo;no farmer&rdquo; and &ldquo;his&rdquo; are
interpreted as a quantifier and a variable, respectively, and the
former binds the latter.</p>

<p>

It is fairly obvious that the bound-variable construal of pronouns is
subject to syntactic constraints. Most importantly, this type of
interpretation requires that the pronoun be
<strong>c-commanded</strong> by its antecedent, where c-command is
defined as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<em>A</em> c-commands <em>B</em> iff <em>B</em> is, or is contained
in, a sister constituent of <em>A</em>&apos;s.</blockquote>

<p>

The constituent structure of sentence [2] is [<sub>S</sub>
[<sub>NP</sub> No farmer][<sub>VP</sub> beat [<sub>NP</sub> his
donkey]]]. Here the pronoun is contained in the sister of its
antecedent, so the c-command constraint is met. In [3] &ldquo;no
farmer&rdquo; does not c-command &ldquo;his&rdquo;, and so we predict,
correctly, that the pronoun cannot be bound.</p>

<blockquote>

<table cellspacing="+2" cellpadding="+2">
<tbody>
 <tr>
  <td valign="top">[3]</td>
  <td valign="top"><u>His</u> donkey likes <u>no farmer</u>.</td>
 </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

Since the syntactic structure of [1] is identical to that of [2], we
might wonder if the pronoun in [1] may not be bound by its antecedent,
just as in [2]. If this were possible, there would be two ways of
construing the pronoun in [1]: it could function either as a
referential term or a bound variable. There is evidence that this is
indeed the case:</p>

<blockquote>

<table cellspacing="+2" cellpadding="+2">
<tbody>
 <tr>
  <td valign="top">[4a]</td>
  <td valign="top"><u>Pedro</u> beats <u>his</u> donkey, and Juan does, too.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td valign="top">[4b]</td>
  <td valign="top"><u>Every farmer</u> beats <u>his</u> donkey, and Juan does, too.</td>
 </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

[4a] is ambiguous in a way [4b] is not. Its second conjunct can be
construed as saying either that Juan beats his own donkey or that Juan
beats Pedro&apos;s donkey. The second conjunct of [4b], by contrast, can
only be interpreted as saying that Juan beats his own donkey. If the
possessive pronoun in the first conjunct of [4a] can be either
referential or a bound variable, the contrast is readily
explained.</p>

<p>

In large part, the motivation for developing dynamic theories of
interpretation, beginning with DRT, was the realization that the
dichotomy between referential and bound-variable (occurrences of)
pronouns is less natural than one might think&mdash;less natural in
the sense that some pronouns don&apos;t fit comfortably in either
category.</p>

<blockquote>

<table cellspacing="+2" cellpadding="+2">
 <tr>
  <td valign="top">[5a]</td>
  <td valign="top">Pedro owns <u>a donkey</u>.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td valign="top">[5b]</td>
  <td valign="top"><u>It</u> is grey.</td>
 </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

What is the relationship between &ldquo;it&rdquo; in the second
sentence and its antecedent expression in the first? On the one hand,
it cannot be coreference. If the pronoun were coreferential with its
antecedent, the indefinite &ldquo;a donkey&rdquo; would have to be a
referential term, which seems unlikely, e.g. because the negation of
[5a] says not that there is a donkey that Pedro fails to own, but rather
that he doesn't own any donkey, and furthermore, if [5a] is negated,
the anaphoric link between the pronoun and its antecedent is
severed:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
 <tr>
<td valign="top">[6a]</td><td valign="top">Pedro doesn't own <u>a donkey</u>.</td>
<td valign="top">[6b]</td><td valign="top">*<u>It</u> is grey.</td>
 </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

(The asterisk indicates that the sentence is infelicitous if &ldquo;a
donkey&rdquo; is to be interpreted as the antecedent of
&ldquo;it&rdquo;.) Observations like these suggest rather strongly that
indefinites are quantifiers rather than referential terms. However, if
we construe &ldquo;a donkey&rdquo; as an existential quantifier, how
does it manage to bind the pronoun across a sentence boundary?</p>

<p>

The problem with [5] is related to the fact that the pronoun and its
indefinite antecedent occur in different sentences. The following
examples show, however, that similar problems arise within
sentences:</p>

<blockquote>[7a] If Pedro owns <u>a donkey</u>, he beats
<u>it</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote> [7b] Every farmer who owns <u>a donkey</u> beats
<u>it</u>.</blockquote>

<p>

These are the infamous &ldquo;donkey sentences&rdquo;, which were
already discussed by scholastic philosophers, and in modern times were
reintroduced into philosophy by Geach (1962). In these cases it is
obvious that the pronouns don't refer, so they can't be coreferential
with their antecedents, either. Nor are the pronouns bound by their
antecedents, for they aren't c-commanded by them. The constituent
structure of [7b] is roughly as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

[<sub>S</sub> [<sub>NP</sub> Every [<sub>N</sub> farmer who owns
[<sub>NP</sub> a donkey]]] [<sub>VP</sub> beats it]]</blockquote>

<p>

Whatever the syntactical details, &ldquo;a donkey&rdquo; is too deeply
embedded for it to c-command &ldquo;it&rdquo;. The same goes for
[7a]. Hence, the neuter pronouns in these sentences cannot be
construed as bound variables.</p>

<p>

Another way of showing that these pronouns are problematic is by
considering how we might render these sentences in predicate
logic. The most obvious interpretation of [7a] is that Pedro beats
every donkey he owns, and [7b] is naturally interpreted as claiming
that every farmer beats every donkey he owns. (So, somewhat
surprisingly, it appears that the indefinites in these sentences have
universal force.) These readings may be captured as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

[9a] &forall;<em>x</em>[[donkey(<em>x</em>) &amp;
own(Pedro,<em>x</em>)] &rarr; beat(Pedro,<em>x</em>)]</blockquote>

<blockquote>

[9b] &forall;<em>x</em>&forall;<em>y</em>[[farmer(<em>x</em>) &amp;
donkey(<em>y</em>) &amp; own(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)] &rarr;
beat(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)]</blockquote>

<p>

So the problem is not that predicate logic fails to capture the
meanings of [7a] and [7b]. The problem is, rather, how to derive [9a]
and [9b] from [7a] and [7b] in a principled way. In order to derive
these logical forms, we have to assume not only that an indefinite
expression buried in a subordinate position ends up having wide scope,
but also that it acquires universal force in the process. A theory
based on such assumptions might capture the facts, but it would be
clearly ad hoc, and would generate a host of false predictions, as
well.</p>

<p>

The upshot of the foregoing observations is that, apparently,
indefinites are neither quantifiers nor referential terms, and this
problem entrains another one, for as long as it unclear what
indefinites mean, it will also remain obscure how they can serve as
antecedents to pronouns. Later on we will see that very similar
problems arise in seemingly disparate domains, like the interpretation
of tense and presuppositions.</p>

<h2><a name="BasDRT">3. Basic DRT</a></h2>

<p>

This section introduces DRT in informal terms. We show how a hearer
builds up a mental model of the ongoing discourse, dealing not only
with simple sentences, but also with conditionals, quantification, and
anaphora, and we discuss DRT's treatment of indefinites, and how they
are set apart from quantifying expressions.</p>

<h3><a name="KeyIde">3.1 The key ideas</a></h3>

<p>

A discourse representation structure (DRS) is a mental representation
built up by the hearer as the discourse unfolds. A DRS consists of two
parts: a universe of so-called &ldquo;discourse referents&rdquo;,
which represent the objects under discussion, and a set of
DRS-conditions which encode the information that has accumulated on
these discourse referents. The following DRS represents the
information that there are two individuals, one of which is a farmer,
the other a donkey, and that the former chased the latter:</p>

<blockquote>

[1] <strong><font color="#336699">[x, y: farmer(x),
donkey(y), chased(x,y)]</font></strong></blockquote>

<p>

The universe of this DRS contains two discourse referents, <strong><font
 color="#336699">x</font></strong> and
 <strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong>,
and its condition set is {<strong><font color="#336699">farmer(x),
donkey(y), chased(x,y)</font></strong>}.</p>


<p>

A DRS like the one in [1] can be given a straightforward
model-theoretic interpretation. In DRT this is done by means of
<strong>embedding functions</strong>, which are partial functions from
discourse referents to individuals in a given model <em>M</em>. An
embedding function <em>f</em> <strong>verifies</strong> [1] in
<em>M</em> iff the domain of <em>f</em> includes at least <strong><font
color="#336699">x</font></strong> and <strong><font
color="#336699">y</font></strong>, and according to <em>M</em> it is the
case that <em>f</em>(<strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong>) is a
farmer, <em>f</em>(<strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong>) is a donkey,
and <em>f</em>(<strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong>) chased
<em>f</em>(<strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong>).</p>


<p>

Meanwhile it will have become clear that the DRS in [1] is designed to
reflect the intuitive meaning of:</p>

<blockquote>

[2] A farmer chased a donkey.</blockquote>

<p>

Indeed, it is claimed that, in the absence of any information about
the context in which this sentence is uttered, [1] is the semantic
representation of [2]. So the indefinite expressions &ldquo;a
farmer&rdquo; and &ldquo;a donkey&rdquo; prompt the introduction of
two new discourse referents,
<strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong> and <strong><font
color="#336699">y</font></strong>, and contribute the information that
<strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong> is a farmer and <strong><font
color="#336699">y</font></strong> a donkey, while the verb contributes the
information that the former chased the latter.</p>

<p>

If a discourse begins with an utterance of [2], the DRS in [1] is
constructed, and this DRS forms the background against which the next
utterance is interpreted. Suppose now that [2] is followed by a token
of [3a]:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[3a] He caught it.</p>

<p>
[3b] <strong><font color="#336699">[<u>v</u>, <u>w</u>: caught(v,w)]</font></strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>

[3b] is the DRS that reflects the semantic content of [3a] before the
pronouns are resolved. In this DRS, the anaphoric pronouns &ldquo;he&rdquo; and
&ldquo;it&rdquo; in [3a] are represented by the discourse referents
 <strong><font color="#336699">v</font></strong> and
 <strong><font color="#336699">w</font></strong>,
respectively. These discourse referents are underlined to indicate that
they require an antecedent. Since [3a] is uttered in the context of
[1], the next step in the interpretation of this sentence is to merge
the DRS in [3b] with that in [1]. The result of this merging operation
is [4a]:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[4a] <strong><font color="#336699">[x, y, <u>v</u>, <u>w</u>: farmer(x), donkey(y), chased(x,y), caught(v,w)]</font></strong></p>

<p>
[4b] <strong><font color="#336699">[x, y, v, w: v = x, w = y, farmer(x), donkey(y), chased(x,y), caught(v,w)]</font></strong></p>

<p>
[4c] <strong><font color="#336699">[x, y: farmer(x), donkey(y), chased(x,y), caught(x,y)]</font></strong></p>


</blockquote>

<p>

Since [3a] is immediately preceded by [2], the antecedent of
&ldquo;he&rdquo; is probably (though not necessarily) &ldquo;a
farmer&rdquo;, while &ldquo;it&rdquo; is anaphorically dependent on
&ldquo;a donkey&rdquo;. At DRS level, this is represented by equating
the discourse referents
 <strong><font color="#336699">v</font></strong> and
 <strong><font color="#336699">w</font></strong>
with <strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong> and
 <strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong>, respectively. These
operations yield [4b], which is equivalent to [4c].  Either DRS is
verified in a model
<em>M</em> iff <em>M</em> features a farmer who chased and caught a
donkey.</p>


<p>

Thus far, we have only considered DRSs with simple conditions, but in
order to account for negated and conditional sentences, say, complex
conditions are required.</p>

<blockquote>

[5a] Pedro doesn't have a donkey.</blockquote>

<blockquote>

[5b] <strong><font color="#336699">[<sub>1</sub> x:
Pedro(x), &not;[<sub>2</sub> y: donkey(y), owns(x,y)]
]</font></strong></blockquote>


<p>

[5b] is the sentence DRS corresponding to [5a]. This DRS contains a
condition that consists of a DRS prefixed by a negation sign. For ease
of reference we will sometimes adorn DRSs with numerical labels, as we
have done in [5b], and use these in names like &ldquo;[5b<sub>1</sub>]&rdquo;,
&ldquo;[5b<sub>2</sub>]&rdquo;, and so on. In general, labeling of DRSs will be
top-down and left-to-right, so the main (or principal) DRS will always
be number one.</p>

<p>

A function <em>f</em> verifies [5b<sub>1</sub>] in a model <em>M</em>
iff <em>f</em> maps <strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong> onto an
individual in <em>M</em> which &ldquo;is a Pedro&rdquo;, i.e. which is called
&ldquo;Pedro&rdquo;, and <em>f</em> cannot be extended to a function <em>g</em>
which verifies [5b<sub>2</sub>]&mdash;that is to say, no such
<em>g</em> should map <strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong> onto a
donkey that Pedro owns.</p>

<p>

[5b<sub>2</sub>] contains a token of the discourse referent
 <strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong>
 which is introduced externally, in the
DRS in which [5b<sub>2</sub>] is embedded,
i.e. [5b<sub>1</sub>]. Apart from that, [5b<sub>2</sub>] also
introduces a discourse referent of its own, i.e.,
 <strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong>, which is
associated with the indefinite NP &ldquo;a donkey&rdquo;, and whose scope is
delimited by [5b<sub>2</sub>]. Consequently, it doesn't make sense to
refer to
 <strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong>
 outside of [5b<sub>2</sub>].
In DRT, this is taken to explain why the &ldquo;lifespan&rdquo; of the individual
introduced by the indefinite NP in [5a] is delimited by the scope of
the negation operator. If [5a] were followed by [6a], for example, the
pronoun could not be linked to the indefinite:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
 <td valign="top">[6a]</td>
 <td valign="top">It is grey.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td valign="top">[6b]</td>
 <td valign="top"><strong><font color="#336699">[<u>z</u>: grey(z)]</font></strong></td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td valign="top">[6c]</td>
 <td valign="top"><strong><font color="#336699">[<sub>1</sub> x, <u>z</u>:
 Pedro(x), &not;[<sub>2</sub> y:donkey(y), owns(x,y)], grey(z)]</font></strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

If we merge [5b] and [6b], which is the sentence DRS corresponding
with [6a], we obtain [6c]. In this representation, the discourse
referent <strong><font color="#336699">z</font></strong> does not have access to
<strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong>, because <strong><font
color="#336699">y</font></strong> is introduced in a DRS that is not
accessible to the DRS in which <strong><font color="#336699">z</font></strong>
is introduced, and therefore it is not possible to bind
 <strong><font color="#336699">z</font></strong> to
 <strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong>.
 In other words, if [6a] is preceded by
[5a], the pronoun cannot be anaphorically linked to the
indefinite. This prediction appears to be correct.</p>


<p>

Accessibility is in the first instance a relation between DRSs;
derivatively, it is also a relation between discourse
referents. [6c<sub>1</sub>] is accessible to [6c<sub>2</sub>], but not
the other way round, and therefore the discourse referents introduced
in [6c<sub>1</sub>], i.e.  <strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong> and
<strong><font color="#336699">z</font></strong>, are accessible from
[6c<sub>2</sub>], but conversely, if we are in [6c<sub>1</sub>] we
have no access to [6c<sub>2</sub>] and its discourse referents,
i.e. <strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong>.  Thus in [6c] anaphora is
not possible because <strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong> is not
accessible to <strong><font color="#336699">z</font></strong>. In [4a], by
contrast, anaphora is possible, because
 <strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong> and
 <strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong>
are accessible to
 <strong><font color="#336699">v</font></strong> and
 <strong><font color="#336699">w</font></strong>
(the
accessibility relation being reflexive). The notion of accessibility is
crucial to DRT's account of anaphora, and it is important to note that
it is not stipulated, but is entailed by the semantics of the DRS
language. [6c<sub>1</sub>] is accessible to [6c<sub>2</sub>] because
every embedding function that must be considered for [6c<sub>2</sub>]
is an extension of an embedding function for [6c<sub>1</sub>], and it
is for this reason that every discourse referent in [6c<sub>1</sub>] is
also defined in [6c<sub>2</sub>]. The converse, however, does not hold.</p>

<p>

Like negated sentences, conditionals give rise to complex
DRS-conditions, too. (7) gives an example:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
 <td valign="top">[7a]</td>
 <td valign="top">If Pedro owns a donkey, he beats it.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td valign="top">[7b]</td>
 <td valign="top"><strong><font color="#336699">[<sub>1</sub> x: Pedro(x), [<sub>2</sub> y: donkey(y), owns(x,y)] &rArr; [<sub>3</sub> <u>v</u>, <u>w</u>: beats(v,w)]]</font></strong></td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td valign="top">[7c]</td>
  <td valign="top"><strong><font color="#336699">[<sub>1</sub> x, v: v = x, Pedro(x), [<sub>2</sub> y, w: w = y, donkey(y), owns(x,y)] &rArr; [<sub>3</sub> : beats(v,w)] ]</font></strong></td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td valign="top">[7d]</td>
  <td valign="top"><strong><font color="#336699">[<sub>1</sub> x: Pedro(x), [<sub>2</sub> y: donkey(y), owns(x,y)] &rArr; [<sub>3</sub> : beats(x,y)] ]</font></strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>



<p>

[7b] is the sentence DRS which corresponds to [7a], and assuming for
convenience that this sentence is uttered in an empty context, it is
also the initial DRS of the discourse. The complex condition in this
structure is interpreted as follows: if <em>f</em> is to verify
[b<sub>1</sub>] in the current model, then
 <em>f</em>(<strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong>)
 must be an individual called &ldquo;Pedro&rdquo;,
and every extension of <em>f</em> which verifies [b<sub>2</sub>] must
itself be extendable to a function that verifies
[b<sub>3</sub>]. It follows from this that [b<sub>1</sub>] is
accessible to [b<sub>2</sub>], which in its turn is accessible to
[b<sub>3</sub>], and therefore
 <strong><font color="#336699">v</font></strong>
may be linked up to <strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong>
(accessibility being a transitive relation) and
 <strong><font color="#336699">w</font></strong> to
 <strong><font  color="#336699">y</font></strong>.
 The result is [7c], which is equivalent
to [7d], both DRSs saying that Pedro beats every donkey he owns.
</p>

<h3><a name="QuaVsInd">3.2 Quantifiers vs. indefinites</a></h3>

<p>

The interpretation of quantified donkey sentences is very similar to
what we have just seen:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
  <td valign="top">[8a]</td>
  <td valign="top">Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td valign="top">[8b]</td>
  <td valign="top"><strong><font color="#336699">[<sub>1</sub> [<sub>2</sub> x, y: farmer(x), donkey(y), owns(x,y)](&forall;x)[<sub>3</sub> <u>v</u>, <u>w</u>: beats(v,w)] ]</font></strong></td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td valign="top">[8c]</td>
  <td valign="top"><strong><font color="#336699">[<sub>1</sub> [<sub>2</sub> x, y, v, w: v = x, w = y, farmer(x), donkey(y), owns(x,y)](&forall;x)[<sub>3</sub> : beats(v,w)] ]</font></strong></td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td valign="top">[8d]</td>
  <td valign="top"><strong><font color="#336699">[<sub>1</sub> [<sub>2</sub> x, y: farmer(x), donkey(y), owns(x,y)](&forall;x)[<sub>3</sub> : beats(x,y)] ]</font></strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

There are two ways of spelling out the interpretation of so-called
<strong>duplex conditions</strong> of the form <strong><font
color="#336699">K(&forall;x)K&prime;</font></strong>. On its weak
interpretation, [8a] means that every farmer who owns a donkey beats
at least one of the donkeys he owns; on its strong interpretation the
sentence says that every farmer beats every donkey he owns. While the
strong reading is the most natural choice for [8a], other donkey
sentences prefer a weak reading:</p>

<blockquote>

[9] Every farmer who owns a tractor uses
it to drive to church on Sundays.</blockquote>

<p>

The most likely interpretation for [9] to have is that every
tractor-owning farmer uses one of his tractors to drive to church.</p>

<p>

The distinction between weak and strong interpretations is somewhat
mysterious, because it doesn't seem to be an ordinary ambiguity. For
example, donkey sentences with existential quantifiers don't seem to
license strong readings:</p>

<blockquote>

[10] Some farmers who own a donkey beat it.</blockquote>

<p>

This can only be construed as saying that some donkey-owning farmers
beat at least one of their donkeys. More generally, the universally
quantified donkey sentences seem to be the only ones to license both
interpretations. It is not entirely clear why this should be the case
(see Kanazawa 1994, Geurts 2002).</p>

<p>

Whether weak or strong, the interpretation of a condition of the form
<strong><font color="#336699">K(Qx)K&prime;</font></strong>, where
 <strong><font color="#336699">Q</font></strong> may be any quantifier, makes
 <strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong> accessible to
 <strong><font color="#336699">K&prime;</font></strong>,
 and in this respect (which is the
fulcrum of the DRT analysis) conditionals and quantified sentences are
the same. Consequently, the discourse referents
 <strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong> and
 <strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong> in [8b<sub>2</sub>] are accessible to
 <strong><font color="#336699">v</font></strong>
and <strong><font color="#336699">w</font></strong> [8b<sub>3</sub>], and the
latter may be equated to the former.
The resulting representation is [8c], which is equivalent to [8d].</p>

<p>

The DRT analysis of quantified expressions like &ldquo;all&rdquo; or
&ldquo;most&rdquo; is fairly standard. A quantifier binds a variable
and delivers the truth conditions one should expect. Indefinites are
different. An indefinite like &ldquo;a donkey&rdquo; is treated not as
a quantifier but simply as device for introducing a discourse referent
and one or more conditions; on the DRT account, indefinites have no
quantifying force of their own. What quantifying force they seem to
have is not theirs, but derives from the environment in which they
occur. If the semantic material associated with &ldquo;a donkey&rdquo;
is introduced in the main DRS, as in [4c], the quantifying effect will
be existential, owing to the fact that this DRS is verified in a
model <em>M</em> iff <strong>there is</strong> a way of verifying it
in <em>M</em>. If the semantic material associated with &ldquo;a
donkey&rdquo; is introduced in the antecedent of a conditional, as in
[7d], the quantifying effect will be universal, owing to the fact that
a condition
 <strong><font color="#336699">K &rArr; K&prime;</font></strong>
 is verified in <em>M</em>
iff <strong>every</strong> way of
verifying <strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong> can be
extended to a way of
verifying <strong><font color="#336699">K&prime;</font></strong>. This
view on indefinites lies at the heart of DRT.</p>

<p>DRT was one of the
first semantic theories to go beyond the sentence boundary, and take
into account how the interpretation of an expression may depend on the
preceding discourse. Looking back at the examples discussed in the
foregoing, we see that, if the DRT approach is on the right track,
sentence boundaries are not as important as the Fregean conception of
language (which continues to have a strong hold on linguistics and
philosophy) would have it. In particular, there is essentially no
difference between the DRT analyses of cross-sentential anaphora, as
exemplified by the mini-discourse [2]-[3a], and sentence-internal
anaphora, as in [7a] or [9a]. In either case, the pronoun simply
serves to pick up an accessible discourse referent. This raises the
question how DRT's new-fangled notion of anaphora relates to the
dichotomy between referential and bound-variable pronouns.  Curiously,
this issue doesn't seem to have received much attention thus far.</p>

<h3><a name="OneVsTwoLevVerDRT">3.3 One- vs. two-level versions of DRT</a></h3>

<p>

In the foregoing we assumed that the contribution of a sentence to the
discourse, as represented by a DRS, was obtained in two steps. In the
first one, a sentence DRS was constructed in a compositional way; this
part of the construction process we took for granted, but its
implementation wouldn't be too difficult. In the second step, the
sentence DRS was merged with the DRS representing the prior discourse,
and anaphoric references were resolved. This two-stage procedure has
become the industrial standard, but the original version of DRT (Kamp
1981, Kamp and Reyle 1993) was monostratal in the sense that one set
of rules took care of both tasks at once. In the meantime, Kamp and
his co-workers have adopted the two-step method, too (e.g. Kamp et al.
2005).</p>

<p>

In one-level versions of DRT, a single set of rules is used to obtain
the semantic contribution of a sentence. To take a simple example, if
the sentence is &ldquo;It is grey&rdquo;, the first rule to apply will say that
the semantic correlate of the subject is an argument to the predicate
expressed by &ldquo;is grey&rdquo;. Then the two main parts of the sentence are
analysed further, and the pronoun &ldquo;it&rdquo; triggers a rule which at once
deals with the pronoun's lexical content and its context dependence;
i.e. it says that we must select a new discourse referent, link it to
a discourse referent made available by the preceding discourse, and
update the DRS so as to record these changes. In two-level versions of
DRT there is no such rule. Its duties are divided between two separate
mechanisms. In the first stage, a separate DRS is constructed for the
sentence, in which pronouns prompt the introduction of new
discourse referents which are marked as being anaphoric (we use
underlining for this purpose). In the second stage, there is a general
mechanism for dealing with discourse referents that are thus
marked.</p>

<p>

The distinction between one- and two-level versions of DRT is of
interest for at least two reasons. First, once we go beyond basic DRT,
the two-stage system may actually be more economical overall. For
example, if DRT is extended for dealing with presuppositions (see
&sect;5), the one-pass approach becomes unwieldy. Secondly, and
perhaps more importantly, two-stage theories may be viewed as
implementing a distinction between semantics and pragmatics which has
some prima facie plausibility: in the first stage a representation is
computed which is projected from the sentence's lexico-grammatical
structure, while in the second stage, context-dependent aspects of
meaning are dealt with.  This division of labor is reminiscent of the
traditional dichotomy between compositional semantics and
non-compositional pragmatics, but it should be noted that the two do
not coincide. Usually, the &ldquo;semantical&rdquo; part of a two-stage version of
DRT is not compositional in the Fregean sense, because its output is
essentially incomplete; it may contain anaphoric &ldquo;gaps&rdquo;, for
example. Therefore, even if a sentence DRS admits of a
truth-conditional interpretation, it will typically fall short of
capturing everything that is conventionally thought to belong to
truth-conditional content.</p>

<h2><a name="DRSLanSynSemAcc">4. The DRS language: syntax, semantics, accessibility</a></h2>

<p>

In this section we give a more precise description of the DRS language
than we have done so far. We define the syntax of the language,
present a model-theoretic interpretation, and discuss the notion of
accessibility, which figures so prominently in DRT's account of
anaphora.</p>

<h3><a name="Syn">4.1 Syntax</a></h3>

<p>

DRSs are set-theoretic objects built from <strong>discourse
referents</strong> and <strong>DRS-conditions</strong>.  A
DRS-condition is either atomic, in which case it consists of a
predicate and a suitable number of discourse referents, or complex, in
which case it embeds one or two DRSs. Hence, the definition of the DRS
language is by simultaneous recursion:</p>

<blockquote><strong>DRSs and DRS-conditions</strong></blockquote>

<ul>

  <li> A DRS <strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong> is a pair &lt;
 <em>U</em><sub><strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong></sub>,
 <em>Con</em><sub><strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong></sub>&gt;,
 where
 <em>U</em><sub><strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong></sub>
 is a set of discourse referents,
and <em>Con</em><sub><strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong></sub> is a
set of DRS-conditions. </li>

  <li> If <em>P</em> is an n-place predicate, and
 <strong><font color="#336699">x<sub>1</sub></font></strong>, &hellip;,
 <strong><font color="#336699">x<sub>n</sub></font></strong>
are discourse referents, then
 <strong><font color="#336699">P(x<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, x<sub>n</sub>)</font></strong>
 is a DRS-condition. </li>

  <li> If <strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong> and
 <strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong>
 are discourse referents, then
 <strong><font color="#336699">x = y</font></strong> is a
DRS-condition. </li>

  <li> If <strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong> and
 <strong><font color="#336699">K&prime;</font></strong> are DRSs, then
 <strong><font color="#336699">&not;K, K&rArr; K&prime;</font></strong>, and
 <strong><font color="#336699">K v K&prime;</font></strong> are
DRS-conditions. </li>

  <li> If <strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong> and
 <strong><font color="#336699">K&prime;</font></strong> are DRSs and
 <strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong>
 is a discourse referent, then
 <strong><font color="#336699">K(&forall;x)K&prime; </font></strong>
is a DRS-condition. </li>
</ul>

<p>

Note that there are no conditions corresponding to conjoined
sentences. Such sentences are dealt with, rather, by merging the DRSs
associated with their parts, where the merge of two DRSs
 <strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong> and
 <strong><font color="#336699">K&prime;</font></strong>
is defined as their pointwise union:</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
 <td colspan="2"><strong>DRS-merge</strong></td>
</tr>

<tr align="left" valign="top">
 <td>&bull;</td>
 <td> <strong><font color="#336699">K&oplus;K&prime;</font></strong> = &nbsp;
 &lt; <em>U</em><sub><strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong></sub> &cup;
 <em>U</em><sub><strong><font color="#336699">K&prime;</font></strong></sub>,
 <em>Con</em><sub><strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong></sub> &cup;
  <em>Con</em><sub><strong><font color="#336699">K&prime;</font></strong></sub>&gt;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

The merge operation is also used for combining a sentence DRS with the
DRS representing the preceding discourse, so the idea is that there is
no principled distinction between (clausal) conjunction and sentence
 concatenation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Officially, DRSs are set-theoretical objects, but in this article we
use a linear notation. Many sources, including Kamp's own work, employ
a graphical &ldquo;box notation&rdquo; which is sometimes clearer, but less
parsimonious and more difficult to type. To illustrate the various
schemes, here are three ways of representing the content of a
conditional donkey sentence:</p>

<p>

To be clear: the choice between the above three representations is one
of convenience, and not intended to have any theoretical
significance.</p>

<h3><a name="Acc">4.2 Accessibility</a></h3>

<p>

Accessibility is a relation between DRSs that is transitive and
reflexive, i.e. it is a preorder. More in particular, it is the
smallest preorder for which the following holds, for all DRSs
 <strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong>,
 <strong><font color="#336699">K&prime;</font></strong>,
and <strong><font color="#336699">K&Prime;</font></strong>:
 if <em>Con</em><sub><strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong></sub>
 contains a condition of the form &hellip;</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><font color="#336699">&not;K&prime;</font></strong>,
  then <strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong> is accessible to
 <strong><font color="#336699">K&prime;</font></strong></li>
  <li><strong><font color="#336699">K&prime;v K&Prime;</font></strong>, then
 <strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong> is accessible to
 <strong><font color="#336699">K&prime;</font></strong> and
 <strong><font color="#336699">K&Prime;</font></strong></li>
  <li><strong><font color="#336699">K&prime; &rArr; K&Prime;</font></strong>, then
 <strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong> is accessible to
 <strong><font color="#336699">K&prime;</font></strong> and
 <strong><font color="#336699">K&prime;</font></strong>
  is accessible to
 <strong><font color="#336699">K&Prime;</font></strong></li>
  <li><strong><font color="#336699">K&prime;(&forall;x)K&Prime;</font></strong>, then
 <strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong> is accessible to
 <strong><font color="#336699">K&prime;</font></strong> and
 <strong><font color="#336699">K&prime;</font></strong> is accessible to
 <strong><font color="#336699">K&Prime;</font></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>

To illustrate, in the following schematic representations, every DRS
is accessible to all and only those DRSs whose number does not
exceed its own (so every DRS is accessible to itself):</p>

<ul>

  <li><strong><font color="#336699">[<sub>1</sub> &hellip;
 [<sub>2</sub> &hellip; ](&forall;x)[<sub>3</sub>
&hellip; &not;[<sub>4</sub>
&hellip; ] ] ] </font></strong></li>

  <li><strong><font color="#336699">[<sub>1</sub> &hellip;
 [<sub>2</sub> &hellip; ] &rArr; [<sub>3</sub>
&hellip; &not;[<sub>4</sub>
&hellip; ] ] ] </font></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>

The <strong>accessible domain</strong> of a DRS
 <strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong>,
 <em>A</em><sub><strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong></sub>,
is the set of discourse referents that occur in some
 <strong><font color="#336699">K&prime;</font></strong> that is
accessible to
 <strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong>, i.e.,
 <em>A</em><sub><strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong></sub> =
 {<strong><font color="#336699">x:&nbsp; K&prime;</font></strong>
 is accessible to <strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong>
and
 <strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong> &isin;
 <em>U</em><sub><strong><font color="#336699">K&prime;</font></strong></sub>}.
 The main constraint which DRT
imposes on the
interpretation of anaphora is this:</p>

<blockquote>

<strong>Accessibility constraint</strong></blockquote>

<blockquote>

A pronoun is represented by a discourse referent
 <strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong> which must be
equated to some discourse referent
 <strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong>
&isin;
 <em>A</em><sub><strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong></sub>, where
 <strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong> is the
DRS in which
 <strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong> is introduced.
</blockquote>

<p>

It is important to note that neither the notion of accessibility nor
the accessibility constraint need be stipulated. For, as we will
presently see, both follow from the way the DRS language is
interpreted (cf. the notion of variable binding in standard predicate
logic).  Thus, we are not at liberty to modify the accessibility
relation, should we wish to do so, unless we simultaneously revise the truth
conditions associated with the DRS language. The accessibility
constraint is a semantic one.</p>

<p>

As discussed in &sect;2, the main syntactic constraint on
bound-variable pronouns is that they be c-commanded by their
antecedents. The domain of the accessibility constraint overlaps with
that of the c-command constraint, but it is wider. For one thing,
sentence boundaries don't affect accessibility. For another, within
the confines of a sentence, the semantic correlate of an expression
<em>E<sub>1</sub></em> may be accessible to that of
<em>E<sub>2</sub></em>, even if <em>E<sub>1</sub></em> doesn't
c-command <em>E<sub>2</sub></em>.  To illustrate this point, consider
the conditional donkey sentence in [1a] and its sentence DRS in
[1b]:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
  <td valign="top">[1a]</td>
  <td valign="top">[<sub>S</sub> [<sub>S</sub> If [<sub>S</sub> [<sub>NP</sub>
 <span style="border-bottom: 1px solid;">a farmer</span>] [<sub>VP</sub> owns
  <span style="border-bottom: medium double;">a donkey</span>]] [<sub>S</sub>
  <span style="border-bottom: 1px solid;">he</span> beats
 <span style="border-bottom: medium double;">it</span>]&thinsp;]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign="top">[1b]</td>
  <td valign="top"><strong><font color="#336699">[<sub>1</sub> : [<sub>2</sub> x, y: farmer(x), donkey(y), owns(x,y)] &rArr; [<sub>3</sub> <span style="border-bottom: 1px solid;">u</span></font></strong><font color="#336699">, <span style="border-bottom: medium double;">v: beats(u,v)</span>] ]</font></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

Syntactically speaking, neither &ldquo;a farmer&rdquo; nor &ldquo;a
donkey&rdquo; can bind (in the sense of Chomsky 1986 and the immense
secondary literature it generated) an expression beyond the smallest
clause in which they occur. In particular, neither can bind any of the
pronouns in the main clause of [1a]. But the discourse referents
associated with these indefinites, i.e.
 <strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong> and
 <strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong>,
are in the accessible domain of [1b<sub>3</sub>],
and therefore the anaphoric discourse referents in this embedded DRS can be
linked to
 <strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong> and
 <strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong>. Put otherwise, they
are bindable at a semantic but not at a syntactic level.</p>

<h3><a name="Sem">4.3 Semantics</a></h3>

<p>

The truth-conditional semantics of the DRS language is given by
defining when an embedding function <strong>verifies</strong> a DRS in
a given model. An embedding function is a partial mapping from
discourse referents to individuals. Given two embedding functions
<em>f</em> and <em>g</em> and a DRS
 <strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong>, we say that <em>g</em> extends
<em>f</em> with respect to
 <strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong>, or
 <em>f</em>[<strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong>]<em>g</em>
for
short, iff <em>Dom</em>(<em>g</em>) = <em>Dom</em>(<em>f</em>) &cup;
 <em>U</em><sub><strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong></sub>, and for all
 <strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong> in <em>Dom</em>(<em>f</em>):
<em>f</em>(<strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong>) =
 <em>g</em>(<strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong>).
 Viewing functions as set-theoretic objects, this can be
formulated more succinctly as follows:
</p>

<blockquote><em>f</em>[<strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong>]<em>g</em>
iff <em>f</em> &sube; <em>g</em> and <em>Dom</em>(<em>g</em>) = <em>Dom</em>(<em>f</em>)
&cup;
 <em>U</em><sub><strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong></sub></blockquote>

<p>

In the following we define what it takes for an embedding function to
verify a DRS or DRS-condition in a given model. As usual, a model
<em>M</em> is a pair <em>&lt;D,I&gt;</em>, where <em>D</em> is a set
of individuals, and <em>I</em> is an interpretation function that
assigns sets of individuals to one-place predicates, sets of pairs to
two-place predicates, and so on. To enhance the legibility of our
definition somewhat we omit the qualification &ldquo;in M&rdquo; throughout:</p>

 and <em>f</em> verifies
 <strong><font color="#336699">K</font></strong> in <em>M</em>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

To see how accessibility follows from these definitions, the critical
junctures are the points at which extensions of embedding functions
are called for. For example, consider a schematic DRS with a
conditional in it:</p>

<blockquote>

[2] <strong><font color="#336699">[x: A(x), [y: B(x,y)] &rArr; [z: C(x,y,z)] ]</font></strong>

</blockquote>

<p>

This DRS is true iff we can find an embedding function <em>f</em>,
<em>Dom</em>(<em>f</em>) = {<strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong>},
which verifies all conditions in [2], which is to say that
<em>f</em>(<strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong>) must be an
 <strong><font color="#336699">A</font></strong>, and <em>f</em> verifies the complex
condition
 <strong><font color="#336699">[y: B(x,y)] &rArr; [z: C(x,y,z)]</font></strong>.
 The latter requirement is met iff every
extension <em>g</em>
of <em>f</em>, <em>Dom</em>(<em>g</em>) =
 <strong><font color="#336699">{x,y}</font></strong>,
such that <em>g</em> verifies
 <strong><font color="#336699">[y: B(x,y)]</font></strong>
can be extended to a function <em>h</em>, <em>Dom</em>(<em>h</em>) =
 <strong><font color="#336699">{x,y,z}</font></strong>, such that <em>h</em> verifies
 <strong><font color="#336699">[z: C(x,y,z)]</font></strong>. Hence, no matter how
we choose <em>g</em>,
 <em>g</em>(<strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong>)
must be the
same individual as
 <em>f</em>(<strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong>),
and for any <em>g</em>, no matter how we choose <em>h</em>,
 <em>h</em>(<strong><font  color="#336699">x</font></strong>)
and <em>h</em>(<strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong>) must be the same
as <em>g</em>(<strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong>) and
 <em>g</em>(<strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong>), respectively. This is why
 <strong><font color="#336699">x</font></strong>
is in the accessible domain associated with the antecedent of the
conditional, and why
 <strong><font color="#336699">y</font></strong> is in the
accessible domain associated with the
consequent.</p>

<h2><a name="BeyBas">5. Beyond the basics</a></h2>

<p>

The purpose of this section is to illustrate how the ideas lying at
the heart of DRT have been applied elsewhere, confining our attention
to the domains of tense and presupposition. In both cases, we will
find interpretative dependencies reminiscent of the dependency
relation between an anaphor and its antecedent, and we will describe,
if only in outline, how basic DRT has been extended so as to explain
the similarities.</p>

<h3><a name="Ten">5.1 Tense</a></h3>

<p>

In the early 1970s, it was pointed out that there are systematic
parallels between tenses and pronouns (Partee 1973), and DRT was
partly born from the conviction that a theory of interpretation should
account for these parallels. Partee (1984) herself worked out some of
these ideas in the DRT framework. In the following we will briefly
discuss some of Partee's observations, and outline a DRT
treatment.</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
  <td valign="top">[1a]</td>
  <td valign="top">Pedro owns a donkey. He beats it.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td valign="top">[1b]</td>
  <td valign="top">Yesterday, Pedro tried to kiss Juanita. She slapped him.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

Intuitively, the indefinite description &ldquo;a donkey&rdquo; in the opening
sentence of [1a] serves to introduce an entity that is subsequently
picked up the pronoun &ldquo;it&rdquo; in the second sentence, and the DRT account
of indefinites and pronouns seeks to formalize this intuitive
picture. [1b] shows that a very similar phenomenon occurs in the
temporal domain, for in this case it is natural to construe the past
tense of the second sentence as being anaphorically dependent on the
content of the first: presumably, Juanita slapped Pedro right after he
tried to kiss her. In order to capture this idea, DRT adopts an
event-based semantics, treating events as semantic values of a
designated class of discourse referents. Sentences are now construed
like indefinite descriptions in that they, too, serve to introduce
discourse referents. For example, the first sentence in [1b]
introduces a discourse referent of the event type that represents
Pedro's attempting to kiss Juanita, and the tense morpheme in
&ldquo;slapped&rdquo; is construed as referring back, very much like an anaphoric
pronoun, to that event: by default, the time of Juanita's slapping
Pedro will be taken to be immediately after the time of him trying to
kiss her.</p>

<p>

Our second example involves what one might call &ldquo;donkey tense&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
  <td valign="top">[2a]</td>
  <td valign="top">Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td valign="top">[2b]</td>
  <td valign="top">Whenever Pedro tried to kiss Juanita, she slapped him.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

In an event-based semantics, it is natural to construe [2b] as
quantifying over events, just like [2a] quantifies over
individuals. In conjunction with the DRT treatment of quantification,
this allows us to interpret the tense in &ldquo;slapped&rdquo; as referring back
to the event introduced in the subordinate clause, along the following
lines (where &ldquo;&sup;&sub;&rdquo; stands for the &ldquo;right after&rdquo;
relation, <font color="#336699">e&Prime;</font> is the variable introduced by the
tense in &ldquo;slapped&rdquo;, and
 <font color="#336699"><span style="border-bottom: 1px solid;">e</span>&Prime;</font>
indicates that  <font color="#336699">e&Prime;</font> requires an antecedent):</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
  <td valign="top">[3a]</td>
  <td valign="top"><strong><font color="#336699">[x, y: Pedro(x), Juanita(y),</font></strong>
  <div style="margin-left: 2ex;"><strong><font color="#336699">[e: try-to-kiss(e,x,y)](&forall;e)[e&prime;, <span style="border-bottom: 1px solid;">e</span>&Prime; : e&Prime; &sup;&sub; e&prime;, slap(e&prime;,y,x)]]</font></strong></div></td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td valign="top">[3b]</td>
  <td valign="top"><strong><font color="#336699">[x, y: Pedro(x), Juanita(y),</font></strong>
  <div style="margin-left: 2ex;"><strong><font color="#336699">[e: try-to-kiss(e,x,y)](&forall;e)[e&prime;: e &sup;&sub; e&prime;, slap(e&prime;,y,x)] ]</font></strong></div></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

In [3a] the tense introduces an anaphoric element, which can be bound
in the restrictor of the quantifier, just as an ordinary donkey
pronoun might be bound. The result, after a minor simplification, is
[3b], which says that every event e of Pedro trying to kiss Juanita is
immediately followed by an event e&prime; of her slapping him. Note
that, although this DRS captures the most natural interpretation of
the past tense in &ldquo;slapped&rdquo;, it leaves the past tense in
&ldquo;tried&rdquo; unaccounted for. But this is as it should be, for
if tense is anaphoric, then that tense, too, should be linked to a
salient time point, which seems to be right: in the absence of a
context that furnishes such a time, [2b] is simply infelicitous; it is
like saying &ldquo;He is handsome&rdquo; when it is not clear whom the
pronoun is intended to refer to.</p>

<h3><a name="Pre">5.2 Presupposition</a></h3>

<p>

Presuppositions are chunks of information associated with particular
lexical items or syntactic constructions. There are many such items
and constructions, and the following is just a small selection: </p>

<blockquote>

<strong>Factive verbs</strong>

<table>
<tr>
  <td valign="top">[4a]</td>
  <td valign="top">Juan knows that Pedro beats his donkey.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td valign="top">[4b]</td>
  <td valign="top">Pedro beats his donkey.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<strong>It-clefts</strong>

<table>
<tr>
  <td valign="top">[5a]</td>
  <td valign="top">It's in the stable that Pedro beats his donkey.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td valign="top">[5b]</td>
  <td valign="top">Pedro beats his donkey.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<strong>Definites</strong>

<table>
<tr>
  <td valign="top">[6a]</td>
  <td valign="top">Pedro beats his donkey.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td valign="top">[6b]</td>
  <td valign="top">Pedro has a donkey.</td>
</tr>
</table>

</blockquote>

<p>

Someone who utters any of the [a] sentences commits himself to the
truth of the respective [b] sentence. Of course, this does nothing to
distinguish presuppositions from ordinary entailments, but the
difference becomes apparent when we embed presuppositional expressions
or constructions in non-entailing contexts, as in:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
  <td valign="top">[7a]</td>
  <td valign="top">It isn't in the stable that Pedro beats his donkey.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td valign="top">[7b]</td>
  <td valign="top">Maybe it's in the stable that Pedro beats his donkey.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

Here [5a] is embedded in the scope of a negation operator and a modal
operator, respectively, and it appears that these sentences commit a
speaker to the truth of [5b] just as much as [5a] does. This behavior
sets presuppositions apart from ordinary entailments.</p>

<p>

Generally speaking, presuppositions tend to escape from
<strong>any</strong> embedded position in the sense that, if a
sentence <em>S</em> contains a presupposition-inducing expression
<em>P</em>, an utterance of <em>S</em> will usually imply that
<em>P</em> holds. This is only generally speaking, because this rule,
though correct in the majority of cases, does not hold without
exceptions:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
  <td valign="top">[8a]</td>
  <td valign="top">It may be that Pedro is a mean farmer, and that he beats his donkey.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td valign="top">[8b]</td>
  <td valign="top">It may be that Pedro has a donkey, and that he beats his donkey.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td valign="top">[9a]</td>
  <td valign="top">If Pedro is a mean farmer, he beats his donkey.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td valign="top">[9b]</td>
  <td valign="top">If Pedro has a donkey, he beats his donkey.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

While the [a] sentences would normally commit a speaker to the claim
that Pedro has a donkey, the same does not hold for the [b] sentences.
It appears, therefore, that presuppositions are typically though not
invariably inherited by the sentences in which they occur. This is the
so-called &ldquo;projection problem&rdquo; for presuppositions.</p>

<p>

Considering that anaphora and presupposition were widely discussed
from the late 1960s onwards, it took a remarkably long time before it
was discovered that, in some respects at least, the two phenomena are
very similar (van der Sandt 1992, Kripke 2009). To see how, consider the
following pairs:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
  <td valign="top">[10a]</td>
  <td valign="top">Pedro owns a donkey. Juan knows {it/that he owns a donkey}.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td valign="top">[10b]</td>
  <td valign="top">If Pedro owns a donkey, Juan knows {it/that he owns a donkey}.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td valign="top">[10c]</td>
  <td valign="top">Every farmer who owns a donkey knows {it/that he owns a donkey}.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

It is true that the variants with the &ldquo;that&rdquo;-complements are slightly
odd, but actually the fact that they are proves the point we want to
make; for it is clear that, in these examples, the pronoun &ldquo;it&rdquo; and
the clause &ldquo;that he owns a donkey&rdquo; perform the same duty, and if the
latter sounds somewhat off it is presumably because the former does
the job just as well.</p>

<p>

While the factive verb &ldquo;know&rdquo; triggers the presupposition that its
clausal complement is true, this presupposition is neutralized in [10b]
and [10c]. If presuppositions behave similarly to anaphoric pronouns,
it is clear why that should be so: in both cases, the presupposition
is <strong>bound</strong> sentence-internally, just like the neuter
pronoun is bound.</p>

<p>

Presupposed information is information that is presented as given, and
according to the so-called &ldquo;binding theory&rdquo; of presupposition this
means that presuppositions want to have discourse referents to bind
to (van der Sandt 1992, Geurts 1999).  However, whereas anaphoric pronouns are rarely interpretable in
the absence of a suitable antecedent, the same does not hold for all
presupposition-inducing expressions. For instance, a speaker may
felicitously assert that he met &ldquo;Pedro's sister&rdquo; even if he knows full
well that his audience wasn't aware that Pedro has a sister. In such
cases, Karttunen (1974) and Stalnaker (1974) suggested, presuppositions are generally
<strong>accommodated</strong>, which is to say that the hearer accepts
the information as given, and revises his representation of the
context accordingly. Accommodation, thus understood, is a form of
exploitation in Grice's sense: the purpose of presuppositional
expressions is to signal that this or that information is given, and
if some information is new but not particularly interesting or
controversial (like the fact that somebody has a sister) the speaker
may choose to &ldquo;get it out of the way&rdquo; by presuppositional means.</p>

<p>

The binding theory incorporates the notion of accommodation as
follows. Presuppositions, according to the theory, introduce
information that prefers to be linked to discourse referents that are
already available in the DRS, and in this respect they are like
pronouns. However, if a suitable discourse referent is not available,
a new one will be accommodated, and the presupposition is linked to
that.  Generally speaking, accommodation is not an option in the
interpretation of pronouns, and a possible reason for this is that a
pronoun's descriptive content is relatively poor. Being told that
&ldquo;she&rdquo; is wonderful is not particularly helpful if it isn't
clear who the pronoun is meant to refer to. By contrast, if the
speaker refers to &ldquo;Pedro's sister&rdquo; there is more to go on,
and accommodation becomes feasible. Hence, the binding theory views
pronouns as a special class of presuppositional expressions. While all
presupposition triggers prefer to be bound, pronouns almost always
must be bound. According to the binding theory, this is because
pronouns are descriptively attenuated, and therefore cannot be
construed by way of accommodation.</p>

<h2><a name="RepAttCom">6. Representationalism, attitudes, and compositionality</a></h2>

<p>

The DRT framework is of interest to philosophers of language primarily
because it has enabled perspicuous treatments of a range of natural
language phenomena that have proved recalcitrant over many years, for
example the phenomena involving donkey anaphora, tense and
presupposition discussed above. But there are also several aspects of
the DRT framework itself which are of philosophical interest, largely
connected with the status of DRSs as mental entities.</p>

<p>

DRT is a representational theory of interpretation. In the DRT
framework, sentences have meanings, if at all, only in a derivative
sense: a sentence prompts the hearer to modify his DRS, and it is DRSs
that have a truth-conditional interpretation. Thus, a sentence causes
a DRS
 <strong><font color="#336699">K<sub>i</sub></font></strong> to be
transformed into a DRS
 <strong><font color="#336699">K<sub>i+1</sub></font></strong> (usually, though not
invariably, the process will consist in adding information to
 <strong><font color="#336699">K<sub>i</sub></font></strong>), and at a remove there is an
associated transition at the semantical level, from
 <strong><font color="#336699">K<sub>i</sub></font></strong>'s interpretation to
 <strong><font color="#336699">K<sub>i+1</sub></font></strong>'s.
 Hence, if we could cut out the representational middleman, we would
have a theory that defines sentence meaning in dynamic terms, as a
transition from one semantic object to another. Thus arises the
question whether or not the representational level can be dispensed
with. Kamp (1981) claimed that representations were essential to
his <strong>ur</strong>-version of DRT, which was a subset of our
basic DRT, but in the meantime he was proved wrong by dynamic semantic
theories that recast classical DRT in purely semantical terms:
starting with Barwise (1987) and Rooth (1987), then (with somewhat
more splash) Groenendijk and Stokhof (1989, 1991), and, in perhaps its
neatest formulation, Muskens (1996).</p>

<p>

What does it mean to say that a theory, or framework, is
intrinsically representational, or that the dynamic semantic theories
listed above are not? To be sure, a very determined semanticist could
force all the apparatus of DRSs into his models, producing a
fine-grained semantic theory which, strictly speaking, did not make
use of a level of syntactic representations (perhaps reminiscent of
the dynamic property theory defined by Chierchia 1994). So in this
sense the representations of DRT are dispensible. But this is a very
weak sense. What it suggests is that the issue of whether a theory
should be seen as representational is not clear cut.</p>

<p>

Consider Montague Grammar. It uses a representational language,
Intensional Logic, but Montague (1970) showed that this use of a
higher-order logical representation language was just a convenience,
and completely dispensible. Specifically, Montague Grammar can be used
to define a function directly from sentences of a fragment of natural
language to model-theoretic entities. The same is true of dynamic
semantic theories, except that the model-theoretic entities are a
little different from Montague's. Note, though, that dynamic meanings
capture information about which entities are available for later
anaphoric reference, whereas Montagovian meanings do not. If two
sentences have the same truth conditions, then they should have the
same Montagovian meanings, but may differ in their dynamic
meanings. It is only if the two sentences have both the same truth
conditions and the same anaphoric potential that they will have the
same Montagovian meanings and the same dynamic meanings in theories
like those of Groenendijk and Stokhof and Muskens. But this does not
in itself make dynamic meanings representational. So what makes DRT
representations different? </p>

<p>

In DRT, even if two sentences have both the same truth conditions and
the same anaphoric potential, they may still have different
meanings. Indeed, there is no defining criterion for identity of
meanings in DRT, truth conditional, anaphoric, or otherwise: two
sentences have the same DRT meanings just in case the construction
algorithm gives them the same
 representations.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#3" name="note-3">3</a>]</sup>
Thus, for example, in Montague Grammar we would expect [1a]-[1c] to
all have identical meanings. In a dynamic semantic theory, we might
expect [1a] to differ in meaning from [1b], because [1a] freely
licenses anaphora to the painting that Jane likes, but for [1b] such
anaphora is at least highly marked. Yet on a dynamic semantic theory,
[1a] and [1c] would still have identical meanings. In DRT, different
representations would be formed for each of [1a]-[1c].</p>


<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
  <td valign="top">[1a]</td>
  <td valign="top">Jane likes a painting.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td valign="top">[1b]</td>
  <td valign="top">It is not the case that Jane doesn't like a painting.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td valign="top">[1c]</td>
  <td valign="top">Jane likes a painting and either it is raining or it isn't.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

There is, then, at the very least, a methodological issue separating
DRT from non-representational frameworks: a non-representational
framework is defined with a natural criterion for identity of meaning
of two sentences in mind, and this criterion is related to the
information conveyed by those sentences. But in a representational
framework like DRT the representations themselves provide the only
criterion for judging identity of meaning. So is representationalism
only methodological, a mere convenience? The answer is surely
<strong>no</strong>, for representationalism involves a strong
philosophical claim, namely the claim that DRSs are mental
representations, and in some way capture objects of thought. This
philosophical position is at the heart of at least one application of
DRT, namely the treatment of attitudes. And here we refer not merely
to the linguistic issue of how attitude descriptions are to be
interpreted, but also to the philosophical and psychological issue of
what it is to be the bearer of a mental attitude.</p>

<p>

One of the greatest problems in the treatment of attitudes is the
issue of logical omniscience: humans are cognitively limited agents,
and are not aware of all the consequences of their beliefs and desires. On this
basis, Kamp (1990), for example, argues that the objects of thought
should not be seen as purely model-theoretic entities, for example a
set of belief worlds, as is common in logics of belief from Hintikka
(1962) onwards.  Rather, the logic of belief and other attitudes must
involve mental representations. The problem of logical omniscience is
then resolved in terms of the failure of human agents to perform
logically complete computations over these representations. Such
<strong>structural</strong> models of DRT as a theory of the attitudes
have been developed not only by Kamp, but also by Asher (1986,1989)
and Zeevat (1984,1989a). Note that this body of work not only deals
with the issue of logical omniscience, but also with a range of other
philosophical problems. Perhaps most notable among these is the issue
of how we can bear attitudes to objects in the real world, a problem
that is sharpened somewhat if attitudes are modeled using syntactic
representations.</p>

<p>

The solution adopted by Kamp (1990) and others
involves <strong>anchoring</strong>, whereby the DRS language is
extended to allow discourse referents mentioned in a DRS to be
connected by a special (anchoring) function to objects in the outside
world, or to referents in other attitudinal representations. The
device of anchoring has been used both for the treatment of attitudes
and for the related issue of the interpretation of attitude
descriptions, specifically in the analysis of problems involving
differences between <strong>de re</strong> and <strong>de
dicto</strong> attitude sentences. But it should be realized that a
DRT treatment of the interpretation of attitude descriptions need not
imply that mental attitudes are themselves understood as involving
DRSs. For example, Geurts (1999) develops a DRT treatment of attitudes
and modals, but provides truth conditions for DRS representations of
attitude descriptions in terms of an underlying model in which the
objects of attitudes are not structural, but rather involve a
neo-Hintikkan relation between individuals and sets
of worlds.</p>

<p>

Not only is DRT a representational theory of interpretation, it is a
non-compositional theory as well. These two features are intertwined.
Consider, for instance, the way pronouns are interpreted in basic DRT,
by first setting up a referent marker, which is subsequently linked to
another discourse referent. This is a non-deterministic process, but
even if it were not, it is clear that the anaphoric link is not part
of the meaning of the pronoun. In standard DRT, the pronoun does not,
in and of itself, introduce something into the DRS that has a
model-theoretic interpretation. A standard statement of
compositionality would say that the meaning of compounds must be a
function of the meaning of their components and their mode of
combination. But if some of the components, like pronouns, do not
introduce into the DRS any object that can naturally be described as
the meaning of that object, then it is clear that we do not have a
compositional system.</p>

<p>

How bad is it that we lose compositionality? It is generally agreed that
some of the standard arguments for compositionality are not
particularly compelling. We don't need compositionality to explain why
people can understand an indefinite number of sentences, and we don't
need it for explaining how languages can be learned. To explain such facts, it suffices that there is some procedure
for establishing the meanings of sentences, but it is not strictly
necessary for this procedure to be compositional.  Compositionality is
often viewed as a methodological principle (e.g.  Groenendijk and
Stokhof 1989;1991, Janssen 1997, Dever 1999), since any model of
interpretation can be made compositional if we are sufficiently
relaxed about the nature of lexical meanings and/or the syntactic
structures over which the compositional theory is defined. In the case
of DRT, the standard approaches to making the system compositional
involve dispensing with Kamp's construction algorithm, and replacing
it with a system in which DRSs can be composed either through suitable
merge operations (Zeevat 1989b), or, in dynamic semantic systems like
those of Groenendijk and Stokhof (1989) and Muskens (1996) discussed
above, through use of function application in a lambda calculus. But
it is fair to say that while most such systems capture meanings for
sentences that are closely related to those of original DRT, they do
not capture every aspect of DRT. In particular, anaphora resolution is
part of DRT, but in dynamic semantic systems anaphora resolution is
assumed to be performed by a separate component of the theory. Yet
even this aspect of DRT could, in principle, be captured
compositionally. Indeed, Kamp's original DRT could trivially (though
uninterestingly) be mapped onto a compositional theory with precisely
the same coverage. We would simply take meanings to be partial
functions from DRSs to sets of DRSs, and then replace each
construction rule with an appropriate such function.  For example, the
pronoun meaning could map a DRS to a set of new DRSs in which the
pronoun has been resolved to various values. Sentence (and discourse)
meanings would be obtained by composing such functions appropriately,
producing for any sentence a set of DRSs.</p>

<p>

Compositionality and representationalism are issues that have produced
great disagreement amongst semanticists and philosophers of language,
though less so nowadays than they did in the 1980s. The methodological
view of compositionality has reduced what appeared once to be a
substantive argument to a matter of taste, and as regards DRT it has
been shown that people who care about compositionality are free to
adopt a variant of the original system with many of its features, but
none of its non-compositionality. Similarly, as regards
representationalism, theorists can now adopt a take-it-or-leave-it
approach, unless they specifically want to make claims about the
status of DRSs as mental representations, e.g. as part of a theory of
attitudes and/or attitude reports. And here perhaps common sense has
prevailed. For from a psychological perspective it is surprising that
representationalism would ever have raised much ire: if we adopt a
cognitivist standpoint, and view DRT as a (somewhat abstract) theory
of the psychology of interpretation, then its representationalism
wouldn't be particularly controversial. The prevailing psychological
winds encourage a view of thought as computation over representations
of some sort. For most psychologists, the controversy is not over
whether there exist such representations, but over what the
representations are like.</p>
