<h1>Frege&apos;s Logic, Theorem, and Foundations for Arithmetic</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Jun 10, 1998; substantive revision Tue Apr 3, 2012</em></div>

<p>

Frege formulated two distinguished formal systems and used these
systems in his attempt both to express certain basic concepts of
mathematics precisely and to derive certain mathematical laws from the
laws of logic. In his <em>Begriffsschrift</em> of 1879, he developed a
second-order predicate calculus and used it both to define interesting
mathematical concepts and to state and prove mathematically interesting
propositions. However, in his <em>Grundgesetze der Arithmetik</em> of
1893/1903, Frege added (as an axiom) what he thought was a
distinguished logical proposition (Basic Law V) and tried to derive the
fundamental theorems of various mathematical (number) systems from this
proposition. Unfortunately, not only did Basic Law V fail to be a
logical proposition, but the resulting system proved to be
inconsistent, for it was subject to Russell&apos;s Paradox.
</p>

<p>

Although the inconsistency in Frege&apos;s <em>Grundgesetze</em> is
widely known, it is not very well known that a deep theoretical
accomplishment can be extracted from his work. The
<em>Grundgesetze</em> contains all the essential steps of a valid proof
(in second-order logic) of the fundamental propositions of arithmetic
from a single consistent principle. This consistent principle, known in
the literature as &ldquo;Hume&apos;s Principle&rdquo;, asserts that for any concepts
<em>F</em> and <em>G</em>, the number of <em>F</em>-things is equal to
the number <em>G</em>-things if and only if there is a one-to-one
correspondence between the <em>F</em>-things and the <em>G</em>-things.
In the <em>Grundgesetze</em>, Frege used Basic Law V to derive Hume&apos;s
Principle, but the derivations of the fundamental propositions of
arithmetic from Hume&apos;s Principle do not essentially require Basic Law
V. So by setting aside the derivation of Hume&apos;s Principle from the
inconsistent Basic Law V and focusing on Frege&apos;s proofs of the basic
propositions of arithmetic, his theoretical accomplishment emerges much
more clearly, for his work shows us how to prove the Dedekind/Peano
axioms for number theory from Hume&apos;s Principle in second-order logic.
This achievement, which involves some remarkably subtle chains of
definitions and logical reasoning, has become known as Frege&apos;s Theorem.
[See Boolos (1990), p. 268, Heck 2011.]</p>

<p>

The principal goals of this essay are: (1) to review in some detail
the essential features of Frege&apos;s logical systems, (2) to work through
the derivations involved in Frege&apos;s Theorem, and (3) to frame the most
important philosophical questions that arise in connection with this
theorem. In addition, we hope to prepare students of Frege to read his
original work (in translation) and to prepare the reader to understand
a number of excellent articles in the secondary literature on Frege&apos;s
work.</p>

<p>

To accomplish these goals, we presuppose only a familiarity with the
first-order predicate calculus. We show how to extend this language and
logic to include the most salient features of Frege&apos;s second-order
predicate calculus, his theory of concepts, and his theory of
extensions. Our discussion will be largely based upon material drawn
from Frege&apos;s three principal published works:</p>

<h2><a name="S1">1. Frege&apos;s Predicate Calculus and Theory of Concepts</a></h2>

<p>

In this section, we describe the language and logic of Frege&apos;s
predicate calculus. We explain his function-argument analysis of atomic
sentences and his definition of concepts in terms of functions, give
examples of his &lsquo;concept script&rsquo;, and discuss the Rule of
Substitution in his logic. We also show how Frege&apos;s Rule of
Substitution corresponds to a comprehension principle for concepts in
second-order logic, and we introduce and explain &lambda;-notation to
help us distinguish open formulas and complex names of concepts.
Readers who are already familiar with these ideas may wish to skip
ahead to Section 2.</p>

<h3><a name="1.1">1.1 The Language</a></h3>

<p>

In <strong>Begr</strong>, Frege invented the predicate calculus. It
will soon become clear that the language and logic of his predicate
calculus are &lsquo;second-order&rsquo;. The language included not only
the variables <em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>,&Scaron;&hellip;&Scaron;,
which range over <em>objects</em>, but also included the variables
&fnof;,<em>g</em>,<em>h</em>,&Scaron;&hellip;&Scaron;, which range over
<em>functions</em>. Frege rigidly distinguished objects from functions
and so we may think of these variables as ranging over separate,
mutually exclusive domains. Frege took functional application
&lsquo;&fnof;(<em>x</em>)&rsquo; as the principal operation for forming
complex names of objects in his language. The expression
&lsquo;&fnof;(<em>x</em>)&rsquo; denotes the object to which the
function &fnof; maps the object <em>x</em>. Frege called the object
<em>x</em> the &lsquo;argument&rsquo; of the function &fnof; and called
&fnof;(<em>x</em>) the &lsquo;value&rsquo; of the function. Since Frege
also recognized two special objects he called <em>truth-values</em>
(The True and The False), he defined a <em>concept</em> to be any
function that always maps its arguments to truth-values. For example,
whereas &lsquo;<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> +3&rsquo; and
&lsquo;father-of(<em>x</em>)&rsquo; denote ordinary functions, the
expressions &lsquo;Happy(<em>x</em>)&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>x</em> &amp;gt;
5&rsquo; denote concepts. The former denotes a concept which maps any
object that is happy to The True and all other objects to The False;
the latter denotes a concept that maps any object that is greater than
5 to The True and all other objects to The False. Given that concepts
like <em>being happy</em> and <em>being greater than</em> 5 map their
arguments to truth values, the atomic sentences of Frege&apos;s language,
such as &lsquo;Happy(<em>b</em>)&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>4</em> &amp;gt;
5&rsquo;, become <em>names</em> of truth-values.</p>

<p>

In what follows, we use the symbols
<em>F</em>,<em>G</em>,&Scaron;&hellip;&Scaron;as variables ranging over
concepts and we often write &lsquo;<em>Fx</em>&rsquo; (instead of
&lsquo;<em>F</em>(<em>x</em>)&rsquo;) to express the claim that concept
<em>F</em> maps <em>x</em> to The True. When this claim is true, Frege
would say that <em>x</em> <em>falls under</em> the concept
<em>F</em>.</p>

<p>

When &fnof; is a function of two arguments <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>
and &fnof; always maps its pair of arguments to a truth value, Frege
would say that &fnof; is a relation. We shall use the expression
&lsquo;<em>Rxy</em>&rsquo; (or sometimes
&lsquo;<em>R</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)&rsquo;) to assert that the
relation <em>R</em> maps <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> (in that order) to
The True. In what follows, we shall sometimes write the symbol that
denotes a mathematical relation in the usual &lsquo;infix&rsquo;
notation; for example, &lsquo;&amp;gt;&rsquo; denotes the greater-than
relation in the expression &lsquo;<em>x</em> &amp;gt;
<em>y</em>&rsquo;.</p>

<p>

Now that we have explained Frege&apos;s analysis of the atomic statements
&lsquo;<em>Fx</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>Rxy</em>&rsquo; familiar to
modern students of logic, we turn next to the more complex statements
of his language. Frege developed his own graphical notation for
asserting complex statements involving negations, conditionals, and
universal quantification. Moreover, he used Gothic letters as
variables of quantification. A summary of Frege&apos;s notation for the
logical notions &lsquo;not&rsquo;, &lsquo;if-then&rsquo;,
&lsquo;every&rsquo; and &lsquo;some&rsquo; is given in the following
 <a name="FregeNotation">table</a>:</p>


<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">

<td align="center"><strong>Modern<br></br>Notation</strong></td>

<tr valign="top">
<td align="left">Some <em>x</em> is such that <em>Fx</em></td>

&Scaron; &exist;<em>xFx</em></td>
<td align="left"><img src="somexFx.png" alt="Frege-notation for: some x Fx" width="80"></img></td>

<tr valign="top">

<tr valign="top">
<td align="left">Some <em>F</em> is such that <em>Fa</em></td>
<td align="left">&not;&forall;<em>F</em>&not;<em>Fa</em>, &Scaron; i.e.,
&Scaron; &exist;<em>F Fa</em></td>
<td align="left"><img src="someFFa.png" alt="Frege-notation for: some F Fa" width="72"></img></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>So, for example, whereas a modern logician would symbolize the claim
&lsquo;All <em>A</em>s are <em>B</em>s&rsquo; as: </p>

<blockquote>
 &forall;<em>x</em>(<em>Ax</em> &rarr; <em>Bx</em>)</blockquote>

<p>Frege would symbolize this claim as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
 <img src="AllAsareBs.png" alt="Frege-notation for: All As are Bs" width="76"></img></blockquote>

<p>However, since Frege&apos;s notation was never adopted as a standard, we
shall instead use the more familiar modern notation in the remainder of
this essay. [See Beaney (1997, Appendix 2), Furth (1967), and
Reck &amp;amp; Awodey (2004, 26&ndash;34) for a more
detailed introduction to Frege&apos;s notation.] We shall assume that the
reader is familiar with the fact that negations
(&lsquo;&not;&phi;&rsquo;) and conditionals
(&lsquo;&phi;&Scaron;&rarr;&Scaron;&psi;&rsquo;) can be used to define the
other molecular formulas such as conjunctions
(&lsquo;&phi;&Scaron;&amp;amp;&Scaron;&psi;&rsquo;), disjunctions
(&lsquo;&phi;&Scaron;&or;&Scaron;&psi;&rsquo;), and biconditionals
(&lsquo;&phi;&Scaron;&equiv;&Scaron;&psi;&rsquo;). Moreover, it is
important to mention that Frege took identity statements of the form
&lsquo;<em>x</em> = <em>y</em>&rsquo; as primitive in his language.
Whereas &lsquo;2<sup>2</sup> = 4&rsquo; names The True,
&lsquo;2<sup>2</sup> = 3&rsquo; names The False. The statement form
&lsquo;&fnof;(<em>x</em>) = <em>y</em>&rsquo; plays an important role
in Frege&apos;s axioms and definitions. Note finally that since Frege
allowed quantification over both objects and functions, the language of
his predicate calculus becomes &lsquo;second-order&rsquo;. </p>

<h3><a name="1.2">1.2 The Logic</a></h3>

<p>

Frege&apos;s logic consisted of basic axioms and rules of inference that
governed the permissible inferences within his system. His axioms
included familiar axioms of propositional logic, second-order predicate
logic, and the logic of identity. For example, where &phi; and &psi;
are any formulas and &lsquo;<em>a</em>&rsquo; is any object term and
&lsquo;<em>P</em>&rsquo; is any concept term, then the following were
among the basic laws of Frege&apos;s system: </p>

<ul>
<li>&phi; &rarr; (&psi; &rarr; &phi;)</li>

<li>(&forall;<em>xPx</em>) &rarr; <em>Pa</em></li>

<li>(&forall;<em>F Fa</em>) &rarr; <em>Pa</em></li>

<li><em>a = b</em> &rarr; &forall;<em>F</em>(<em>Fa</em> &equiv;
<em>Fb</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>

[Frege&apos;s most well-known codification of these laws occurs in
<strong>Gg I</strong>, &sect;47; however, the above laws are first
introduced in <strong>Gg I</strong>, &sect;&sect;18, 20, 25, and 20,
respectively.] We shall simplify our discussion in what follows by
assuming that the usual axioms of the modern second-order predicate
calculus apply to Frege&apos;s system. These are essentially the same as the
axioms for the first-order predicate calculus, except for the addition
of laws for the second-order quantifiers &forall;<em>F</em> and
&exist;<em>F</em> which correspond to the laws governing the
first-order quantifiers &forall;<em>x</em> and &exist;<em>x</em>. </p>

<p>

Although these axioms of Frege&apos;s logic are familiar to us, the rules
of inference in Frege&apos;s system are not as familiar. The reason is that
the rules govern not only his graphical notation for molecular and
quantified formulas, but also his special purpose symbols, such as
certain lowercase letters used as placeholders, certain Gothic letters and
letters used as bound variables, and various other signs of his system
we have not yet mentioned. Since these will play no role in the
discussion that follows, we shall again simplify our discussion by
assuming that the usual rules of the modern second-order predicate
calculus apply to Frege&apos;s system. Again, these are essentially the same
as the rules for the first-order predicate calculus, except for the
addition of new rules for the second-order quantifiers that correspond
to the generalization and instantiation rules (i.e., introduction and
elimination rules) for the first-order quantifiers.</p>

<h3><a name="1.3">1.3 The Rule of Substitution</a></h3>

<p>There is, however, one distinguished rule of Frege&apos;s system that will
play an important role in what follows, namely, his Rule of
Substitution. For the purposes of this discussion, we may initially
formulate the rule in the following somewhat simplified manner: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Rule of Substitution</strong> (Simplified Version):
<br></br>
 In any statement of the form &hellip;<em>Fx</em>&hellip; (in which the
variable <em>F</em> is free) which is derivable as a theorem of logic,
we may substitute any open formula &phi;(<em>x</em>) (with the free
variable <em>x</em>) for all the occurrences of the atomic formula
<em>Fx</em> in &hellip;<em>Fx</em>&hellip;&Scaron;.</blockquote>

<p>To see this rule in action, first consider the following theorem of
(Frege&apos;s) second-order predicate logic: </p>

<blockquote>
 (A) &forall;<em>x</em>(<em>Fx</em> &equiv;
<em>Fx</em>).</blockquote>

<p>Now Frege&apos;s Rule of Substitution not only allows us to substitute the
atomic formula &lsquo;<em>Ox</em>&rsquo; (which might represent the
claim &lsquo;<em>x is odd</em>&rsquo;) for the formula <em>Fx</em> to
derive the true statement &forall;<em>x</em>(<em>Ox</em> &equiv;
<em>Ox</em>), but also allows us to substitute complex formulas with a
free variable <em>x</em> for &lsquo;<em>Fx</em>&rsquo;. So, for
example, we are allowed substitute the formula &lsquo;<em>Ox</em> &amp;amp;
<em>x</em> &amp;gt; 5&rsquo; (&lsquo;<em>x</em> is odd and <em>x</em> is
greater than 5&rsquo;) for &lsquo;<em>Fx</em>&rsquo; in (A) to derive
the following from (A): </p>

<blockquote>
 (B) &forall;<em>x</em>(<em>Ox</em> &amp;amp; <em>x</em> &amp;gt; 5
&equiv; <em>Ox</em> &amp;amp; <em>x</em> &amp;gt; 5)</blockquote>

<p>Inferences such as this will be valid no matter what complex formula
with <em>x</em> free we substitute for <em>Fx</em> in our universal
claim (A). This is what justifies Frege&apos;s Rule of Substitution. </p>

<p>

In what follows, we will assume that the Rule of Substitution can be
generalized to relations, so that we can uniformly replace the formula
<em>Rxy</em> (in a theorem of logic with <em>R</em> free) by a complex
formula &phi;(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) (in which both <em>x</em> and
<em>y</em> are free).</p>

<h3><a name="1.4">1.4 The Theory of Concepts</a></h3>

<p>The Rule of Substitution has rather powerful consequences. It implies
that there exists a concept corresponding to every open formula with a
free variable <em>x</em>. To see that this is a consequence of the
rule, note that it follows from (A) by existential generalization that:</p>

<blockquote>
 &exist;<em>G</em>&forall;<em>x</em>(<em>Gx</em> &equiv;
<em>Fx</em>)</blockquote>

<p>Frege&apos;s Rule of Substitution now allows us to substitute any formula
with free variable <em>x</em> for <em>Fx</em>. In other words, every
instance of the following Comprehension Principle for Concepts is
derivable in Frege&apos;s system: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Comprehension Principle for Concepts</strong>:
<br></br>
 &exist;<em>G</em>&forall;<em>x</em>(<em>Gx</em> &equiv;
&phi;(<em>x</em>)),
<br></br>
 where &phi;(<em>x</em>) is any formula which has <em>x</em> free and
which has no free <em>G</em>s.</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, from the theorem of logic:</p>

<blockquote>
 &forall;<em>x</em>&forall;<em>y</em>(<em>Rxy</em> &equiv;
<em>Rxy</em>)</blockquote>

<p>one can generalize and then use the Rule of Substitution to derive the
following Comprehension Principle for Relations: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Comprehension Principle for Relations</strong>:
<br></br>
 &exist;<em>R</em>&forall;<em>x</em>&forall;<em>y</em>(<em>Rxy</em>
&equiv; &phi;(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)),
<br></br>
 where &phi;(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) is any formula with <em>x</em> and
<em>y</em> free and which has no free <em>R</em>s.</blockquote>

<p>Although Frege didn&apos;t explicitly formulate these Comprehension
Principles, they constitute a very important generalization about his
system that reveals its underlying theory of concepts and relations. We
can see these principles at work if we return to the example used
above. The following is an instance of the Comprehension Principle for
Concepts and so constitutes a theorem of Frege&apos;s system: </p>

<blockquote>
 &exist;<em>G</em>&forall;<em>x</em>(<em>Gx</em> &equiv;
<em>Ox</em> &amp;amp; <em>x</em> &amp;gt; 5)</blockquote>

<p>This asserts: there exists a concept <em>G</em> such that for every
object <em>x</em>, <em>x</em> falls under <em>G</em> if and only if
<em>x</em> is odd and greater than 5. We can see, therefore, that
Frege&apos;s Rule of Substitution essentially treats an open formula like
&lsquo;<em>Ox</em> &amp;amp; <em>x</em> &amp;gt; 5&rsquo; as if it were a name
of a complex concept. Similarly, the following is an instance of the
Comprehension Principle for Relations: </p>

<blockquote>

&exist;<em>R</em>&forall;<em>x</em>&forall;<em>y</em>(<em>Rxy</em>
&equiv; <em>Ox</em> &amp;amp; <em>x</em> &amp;gt; y)</blockquote>

<p>This asserts the existence of a relation that objects <em>x</em> and
<em>y</em> bear to one another just in case the complex condition
<em>Ox</em> &amp;amp; <em>x</em> &amp;gt; <em>y</em> holds. </p>

<p>

Logicians nowadays typically distinguish the open formula
&phi;(<em>x</em>) from the corresponding name of a concept. They use
the notation [&lambda;<em>x</em> <em>Ox</em> &amp;amp; <em>x</em> &amp;gt; 5]
as the name of the concept <em>being an object x such that x is odd and
x is greater than</em> 5 (or, more naturally, &lsquo;being odd and
greater than 5&rsquo;). The term-forming operator &lambda;<em>x</em>
(&lsquo;being an <em>x</em> such that&rsquo;) combines with a formula
&phi;(<em>x</em>) in which <em>x</em> is free to produce
[&lambda;<em>x</em> &phi;(<em>x</em>)]. The &lambda;-expression is a
name of the concept expressed by the formula. This notation can be
extended for relational concepts. The expression:</p>

<blockquote>
 [&lambda;<em>x</em><em>y</em> <em>Ox</em> &amp;amp; <em>x</em>
&amp;gt; <em>y</em>]</blockquote>

<p>
 names the 2-place relation <em>being an x and y such that x is odd and
greater than y</em>. So we will use expressions of the more general
form [&lambda;<em>x</em><em>y</em> &phi;(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)] in
what follows. [The reader should note, however, that we are taking
&lambda;-expressions to be complete expressions that denote concepts.
But Frege didn&apos;t use this notation.  By contrast, he thought that
predicative expressions such as &lsquo;(&Scaron;) is happy&rsquo; are
incomplete expressions and that the concepts they denoted were
<em>unsaturated</em>. We shall not discuss Frege&apos;s reasons for this in
this entry; see his essay &ldquo;Concept and Object&rdquo;.]</p>

<p>

This &lambda;-notation is governed by the following simple logical
principle known as &lambda;-Conversion. Let &phi;(<em>x</em>) be any
formula in which the variable <em>x</em> is free, and let
&phi;(<em>y</em>/<em>x</em>) be the result of substituting the variable
<em>y</em> for <em>x</em> everywhere in &phi;(<em>x</em>). Then the
principle of &lambda;-Conversion is:</p>

<blockquote>
 &lambda;-<strong>Conversion</strong>:
<br></br>
 &forall;<em>y</em>([&lambda;<em>x</em> &phi;(<em>x</em>)]<em>y</em> &equiv;
&phi;(<em>y</em>/<em>x</em>))</blockquote>

<p>This asserts that an object <em>y</em> falls under the concept
[&lambda;<em>x</em> &phi;(<em>x</em>)] if and only if
&phi;(<em>y</em>/<em>x</em>) holds. So, using our example, the
following is an instance of &lambda;-conversion: </p>

<blockquote>
 &forall;<em>y</em>([&lambda;<em>x</em> <em>Ox</em> &amp;amp;
<em>x</em> &amp;gt; 5]<em>y</em> &equiv; <em>Oy</em> &amp;amp; <em>y</em> &amp;gt;
5)</blockquote>

<p>This asserts that an object <em>y</em> falls under the concept
<em>being odd and greater than</em> 5 if and only if <em>y</em> is odd
and greater than 5. Note that when the variable <em>y</em> is
instantiated to some object term, the resulting instance of
&lambda;-Conversion is a biconditional. Some logicians call the rule of
inference derived from the right-to-left direction of such
biconditionals &lsquo;&lambda;-Abstraction&rsquo;. For example, the
inference from </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>O</em>6 &Scaron;&amp;amp;&Scaron; 6 &amp;gt; 5</blockquote>

<p>to </p>

<blockquote>
 [&lambda;<em>x</em> <em>Ox</em> &amp;amp; <em>x</em> &amp;gt;
5]6</blockquote>

<p>is justified by &lambda;-Abstraction. </p>

<p>

The principle of &lambda;-Conversion can be generalized, so that it
covers relations as well:</p>

<blockquote>

&forall;<em>z</em>&forall;<em>w</em>([&lambda;<em>x</em><em>y</em>
&phi;(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)]<em>zw</em> &equiv;
&phi;(<em>z</em>/<em>x</em>, <em>w</em>/<em>y</em>))</blockquote>

<p>The reader should construct an instance of this principle using our
example [&lambda;<em>x</em><em>y</em> <em>Ox</em> &amp;amp; <em>x</em> &amp;gt;
y].</p>

<p>

To reiterate, then, Frege&apos;s Rule of Substitution allows us to
instantiate &phi;(<em>x</em>) for the free variable <em>F</em> in
theorems of logic as if &phi;(<em>x</em>) were a &lambda;-expression
and constituted a name of a concept. In what follows, we shall make use
of this &lambda;-notation. Indeed, &lambda;-notation is required if we
are to give a more precise formulation of the Rule of Substitution; the
precise formulation of the rule for concepts is:</p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Rule of Substitution</strong>:
<br></br>
 The &lambda;-expression [&lambda;<em>x</em> &phi;(<em>x</em>)] may be
uniformly substituted for the occurrences of the variable <em>F</em> in
any theorem of logic containing <em>F</em> free.</blockquote>

<p>(The formulation for relations is similar.) Moreover, the principle of
&lambda;-Conversion simplifies the strict proof of the equivalence of
Frege&apos;s Rule of Substitution and the Comprehension Principle for
Concepts. As it turns out, not only does Frege&apos;s Rule of Substitution
imply the Comprehension Principle for Concepts, but the converse also
holds: the Comprehension Principle for Concepts implies the Rule of
Substitution. [For a proof sketch, see Boolos (1985) pp. 161&ndash;162. Note
that instead of [&lambda;<em>x</em> &phi;(<em>x</em>)], Boolos uses the
notation {<em>a</em>: <em>Aa</em>}; elsewhere, in (1987) for example,
Boolos uses the notation [<em>x</em> : <em>A</em>(<em>x</em>)] to
denote concepts.]</p>

<p>

It is important to appreciate that the system we have just
described, i.e., Frege&apos;s system of second-order logic and the theory of
(relational) concepts that he developed in <strong>Begr</strong>, is
consistent. (It is only later in <strong>Gg</strong>, when Frege added
Basic Law V to this consistent basis, that the resulting system became
inconsistent.) Its underlying comprehension principle for concepts
ensures that the domain of concepts is very rich. Each concept has a
negation, every pair of concepts has a conjunction, every pair of
concepts has a disjunction, etc. The reader should be able to write
down instances of the comprehension principle which demonstrate these
claims. In Part III of <strong>Begr</strong>, Frege applied his system
to the &lsquo;theory of sequences&rsquo; (we call these
&lsquo;<em>R</em>-series&rsquo; below). It is here that Frege presents
his celebrated definition of the &lsquo;ancestral&rsquo; of a relation
and first proves the generalized analogues of the principle of
mathematical induction, as well as various structural properties of the
ancestral. We shall postpone further discussion of this work until
&sect;&sect;4 and 5, where we reproduce Frege&apos;s definition of the
ancestral of a relation and show how Frege incorporated this definition
into the proof of mathematical induction, respectively.</p>

<h2><a name="S2">2. Frege&apos;s Theory of Extensions: Basic Law V</a></h2>

<p>[Note: This section is included to give an historical understanding of
Frege&apos;s system. It is not required for understanding the proof of
Frege&apos;s Theorem.]</p>

<p>

The principle that undermined Frege&apos;s system (Basic Law V) was one
that attempted to systematize the notions &lsquo;course-of-values of a
function&rsquo; and &lsquo;extension of a concept&rsquo;. The
course-of-values of a function &fnof; is something like a set of
ordered pairs that records the value &fnof;(<em>x</em>) for every
argument <em>x</em>. For example, the course-of-values of the function
<em>father of x</em> records, among other things, that Bill Clinton is
the value of the function when Chelsea Clinton is the argument. The
course-of-values for the function <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> records, among
other things, that the number 4 is the value when the number 2 is the
argument, that 9 is the value when 3 is the argument, etc. The
extension of a concept is something like the set of all objects that
fall under the concept. For example, the extension of the concept <em>x
is a positive even integer less than 8</em> is something like the set
consisting of the numbers 2, 4, and 6 (strictly speaking, the extension
of this concept records The True as the value when 2, 4 and 6 are
supplied as argument, and records that The False is the value when
anything else is supplied as argument). Since concepts are just
functions from objects to truth values, the extension of a concept is
simply the course-of-values which records which objects that concept
maps to The True.</p>

<h3><a name="2.1">2.1 Notation for Courses-of-Values of Functions</a></h3>

<p>Frege introduces primitive notation for courses-of-values in <strong>Gg
I</strong>, &sect;9. He switched to the lower case Greek letters epsilon and
alpha when writing the names of courses-of-values and extensions, and placed
smooth breathing marks over them when to indicate they were variable-binding
operators:</p>

<blockquote>
<span class="overstrike">&epsilon;<span class="up">&rsquo;</span></span>&fnof;(&epsilon;)
</blockquote>

<p> and </p>

<blockquote>
<span class="overstrike">&alpha;<span class="up">&rsquo;</span></span><em>g</em>(&alpha;)
</blockquote>

<p>to designate the course-of-values of the functions &fnof; and
<em>g</em>, respectively. In this notation, the symbols
<span class="overstrike">&epsilon;<span class="up">&rsquo;</span></span>
 and
<span class="overstrike">&alpha;<span class="up">&rsquo;</span></span>
 bind the object variables epsilon and alpha, respectively, and the
resulting expression denotes a course-of-values. </p>

<p>

Here is a pair of examples of Frege&apos;s notation for courses-of-values
and the second are examples of extensions. This pair of examples comes
from <strong>Gg I</strong>, &sect;9. Frege uses the expression:</p>

<blockquote>
<span class="overstrike">&epsilon;<span class="up">&rsquo;</span></span>(&epsilon;<sup>2</sup> &minus;  &epsilon;)
</blockquote>

<p>to denote the course-of-values of the function represented by
the open formula: </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> &minus; <em>x</em></blockquote>

<p>He also uses: </p>

<blockquote>
<span class="overstrike">&alpha;<span class="up">&rsquo;</span></span>(&alpha; &middot; (&alpha; &minus; 1))
</blockquote>

<p>to denote the course-of-values of the function represented
by the open formula: </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>x</em> &middot; (<em>x</em> &minus; 1)</blockquote>

<p>Frege then notes that: </p>

<blockquote>
 &forall;<em>x</em>[<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> &minus;
<em>x</em> &Scaron; = &Scaron; <em>x</em> &middot; (<em>x</em> &minus;
1)]</blockquote>

<p>always has the same truth value as the following: </p>

<blockquote>
<span class="overstrike">&epsilon;<span class="up">&rsquo;</span></span>(&epsilon;<sup>2</sup> &minus;  &epsilon;)
 &Scaron; = &Scaron;
<span class="overstrike">&alpha;<span class="up">&rsquo;</span></span>(&alpha; &middot;  (&alpha;
 &minus; 1))
</blockquote>

<p>This equivalence will become embodied in Basic Law V. The reader should
now be in a position to see how the following formulation of Basic Law
V corresponds to Frege&apos;s formulation in <strong>Gg I</strong>,
&sect;20: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Basic Law V</strong>:
<br></br>
<span class="overstrike">&epsilon;<span class="up">&rsquo;</span></span>&fnof;(&epsilon;) =
<span class="overstrike">&alpha;<span class="up">&rsquo;</span></span><em>g</em>(&alpha;)
 &equiv;
 &forall;<em>x</em>[&fnof;(<em>x</em>) = <em>g</em>(<em>x</em>)]
</blockquote>

<p>This principle asserts: the course-of-values of the function &fnof; is
identical to the course-of-values of the function <em>g</em> if and
only if &fnof; and <em>g</em> map every object to the same value.
[Actually, Frege uses an identity sign instead of the biconditional
sign as the main connective of the principle. The reason he could do
this is that, in his system, when two sentences are materially
equivalent, they <em>name</em> the same truth value.] We shall soon
explain why this principle is inconsistent. </p>

<h3><a name="2.2">2.2 Notation for Extensions of Concepts</a></h3>

<p>In what follows, we shall alter Frege&apos;s notation just a bit, to reflect
the fact that we are using a more traditional predicate calculus,
rather than a term logic such as Frege&apos;s. In the special case where
&fnof; is the concept <em>F</em>, we use the primitive notation
&epsilon;<em>F</em> to designate the extension of the concept
<em>F</em>. Note that &lambda;-expressions
[&lambda;<em>x</em>&Scaron;&phi;(<em>x</em>)] can be instances of the
variable <em>F</em>, and so
&epsilon;[&lambda;<em>x</em>&Scaron;&phi;(<em>x</em>)] is well-formed
and designates the extension of the concept
[&lambda;<em>x</em>&Scaron;&phi;(<em>x</em>)]. Thus, we do not use
&epsilon; as an operator which binds object-variables, but rather as a
functional operator on concept terms (i.e., on concept names or
concept variables). When the primitive operator is prefixed to a
concept name, the resulting expression is a name of an object, and in
particular, a name of the extension of the concept denoted by the
concept name. When the operator is prefixed to a concept variable, the
resulting expression is a variable ranging over extensions.</p>

<p>

Here is an example of our notation involving a pair of complex
concepts. Consider the concept <em>that which when added to</em> 4
<em>equals</em> 5, or using &lambda;-notation, the following
concept:</p>

<blockquote>
 [&lambda;<em>x</em>&Scaron;<em>x</em>+4=5]</blockquote>

<p>We use the following notation to denote the extension of this concept: </p>

<blockquote>
 &epsilon;[&lambda;<em>x</em> <em>x</em>+4=5]</blockquote>

<p>Now consider the concept <em>that which when added to</em>
2<sup>2</sup> <em>equals</em> 5 (i.e.,
[&lambda;<em>x</em>&Scaron;<em>x</em>+2<sup>2</sup>=5]). We use the
following notation to denote the extension of this concept: </p>

<blockquote>
 &epsilon;[&lambda;<em>x</em>
<em>x</em>+2<sup>2</sup>=5]</blockquote>

<p>Note that it seems natural to identify these two extensions whenever
all and only the objects that fall under the first concept fall under
the second. </p>

<p>

From these examples, it should be clear that when &phi;(<em>x</em>)
is any formula in which the variable <em>x</em> is free, we may write
&epsilon;[&lambda;<em>x</em>&Scaron;&phi;(<em>x</em>)] to designate the
extension of the concept [&lambda;<em>x</em>&Scaron;&phi;(<em>x</em>)].
Those readers already familiar with the &lambda;-calculus
should remember that
&epsilon;[&lambda;<em>x</em>&Scaron;&phi;(<em>x</em>)] denotes an object,
that [&lambda;<em>x</em>&Scaron;&phi;(<em>x</em>)] denotes a concept, and
that Frege rigorously distinguished objects and concepts and supposed
them to constitute mutually exclusive domains.</p>

<h3><a name="2.3">2.3 Membership in an Extension</a></h3>

<p>If we remember that the extension of a concept is something like the
set of objects that fall under the concept, then we could replace
Frege&apos;s talk of &lsquo;extensions&rsquo; by talk of &lsquo;sets&rsquo;
and use the following &lsquo;set notation&rsquo; to refer to the set of
objects that when added to 4 yield 5 and the set of objects that when
added to 2<sup>2</sup> yield 5, respectively: </p>

<blockquote>
 {<em>x</em> |
<em>x</em> + 4 = 5}

<p>

{<em>x</em> |
<em>x</em> + 2<sup>2</sup> = 5}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In what follows, we sometimes render Frege&apos;s notation in this more
modern notation.</p>

<p>

Frege took advantage of his second-order language to <em>define</em>
what it is for an object to be a member of an extension. Although Frege
used the notation <em>x</em>&Scaron;&cap;&Scaron;<em>y</em> to designate
the membership relation, we shall follow the more usual practice of
using <em>x</em>&Scaron;&isin;&Scaron;<em>y</em>. (Readers should check
that their web browsers are correctly displaying the difference between
the membership sign &isin; and the epsilon operator &epsilon;.) Thus,
the following captures the main features of Frege&apos;s definition of
membership in <strong>Gg I</strong>, &sect;34:</p>

<blockquote>
 <em>x</em> &isin; <em>y</em> =<sub>df</sub>
&exist;<em>G</em>(<em>y</em>=&epsilon;<em>G</em> &Scaron;&amp;amp;&Scaron;
<em>Gx</em>)</blockquote>

<p>In other words, <em>x</em> is an element of <em>y</em> just in case
<em>x</em> falls under a concept of which <em>y</em> is the extension.
For example, given this definition, one can prove that John is a member
of the extension of the concept <em>being happy</em> (formally:
<em>j</em> &isin; &epsilon;H) from the premise that John falls under
the concept <em>being happy</em> (&lsquo;<em>Hj</em>&rsquo;). Here is a
simple proof: </p>

<blockquote>

<table>
<tr valign="top">
<td align="left" width="50%">1. &Scaron; <em>Hj</em></td>
<td align="left" width="50%">Premise</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td align="left">2. &Scaron; &epsilon;<em>H</em> =
&epsilon;<em>H</em></td>
<td align="left">=-Introduction, or from &forall;<em>x</em>(<em>x</em>=<em>x</em>)</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td align="left">3. &Scaron; &epsilon;<em>H</em> = &epsilon;<em>H</em>
&Scaron; &amp;amp; &Scaron; <em>Hj</em></td>
<td align="left">from 1,2, by &amp;amp;-Introduction</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td align="left">4. &Scaron; &exist;<em>G</em>(&epsilon;<em>H</em> =
&epsilon;<em>G</em> &Scaron; &amp;amp; &Scaron; <em>Gj</em>)</td>
<td align="left"><span style="white-space:nowrap;">from 3, by Existential Introduction</span></td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td align="left">5. &Scaron; <em>j</em> &isin; &epsilon;<em>H</em></td>
<td align="left">from 4, by definition of &isin;</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>Some readers may wish to examine a somewhat more complex example, in
which the above definition of membership is used to prove that 1 &isin;
&epsilon;[&lambda;<em>x</em>&Scaron;<em>x</em>+2<sup>2</sup>=5] given the
premise that 1+2<sup>2</sup>=5.
 (<a href="example.html" name="return-ex">A More Complex Example</a>)</p>

<p>Before we turn to Basic Law V, it is important to mention an
important fact about Frege&apos;s system so far, which results from the
introduction of the term-forming operator &epsilon; into Frege&apos;s
classical logic.  The resulting system yields the following principle,
which asserts that every concept has an extension, as a theorem:</p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Existence of Extensions</strong>:
<br></br>
 &forall;<em>G</em>&exist;<em>x</em>(<em>x</em> =
&epsilon;<em>G</em>)</blockquote>

<p>

To see that this is derivable in Frege&apos;s system, note that in line 2
of the proof in the above example, the laws of identity allowed us to
assert that:</p>

<blockquote>
 &epsilon;<em>F</em> = &epsilon;<em>F</em>
</blockquote>

<p> In classical logic, this is directly assertable by the law of
Identity Introduction, or provable from the law of identity,
&forall;<em>x</em>(<em>x</em>=<em>x</em>), given that
&epsilon;<em>F</em> is a singular term.  So, by existential
generalization, it follows that: </p>

<blockquote>
 &exist;<em>x</em>(<em>x</em> = &epsilon;<em>F</em>)</blockquote>

<p>
  But now the Existence of Extensions principle follows by universal
generalization on the concept variable <em>F</em>.  Thus, simply by
adding a term-forming operator such as &epsilon; to his classical
logic with identity, it is provable that every concept gets correlated
with an extension. Basic Law V will not only imply, but also place
a condition on, this correlation.</p>

<h3><a name="2.4">2.4 Basic Law V for Concepts</a></h3>

<p>

Basic Law V has the following special case, when the functions
&fnof; and <em>g</em> are the concepts <em>F</em> and <em>G</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Basic Law V</strong> (Special Case):
<br></br>
 &epsilon;<em>F</em> = &epsilon;<em>G</em> &equiv;
&forall;<em>x</em>(<em>Fx</em> &equiv; <em>Gx</em>)</blockquote>

<p>[Here, again, Frege used an identity sign in place of the biconditional
signs.] In this special case, Basic Law V asserts: the extension of the
concept <em>F</em> is identical to the extension of the concept
<em>G</em> if and only if all and only the objects that fall under
<em>F</em> fall under <em>G</em> (i.e., if and only if the concepts
<em>F</em> and <em>G</em> are materially equivalent). In more modern
guise, Frege&apos;s Basic Law V asserts that the set of <em>F</em>s is
identical to the set of <em>G</em>s if and only if <em>F</em> and
<em>G</em> are materially equivalent: </p>

<blockquote>
 {<em>x</em>|<em>Fx</em>} = {<em>y</em>|<em>Gy</em>} &equiv;
&forall;<em>z</em>(<em>Fz</em> &equiv; <em>Gz</em>)</blockquote>

<p>

The example discussed above can now be seen as an instance of Basic
Law V:</p>

<blockquote>
 &epsilon;[&lambda;<em>y</em> <em>y</em>+4=5] =
&epsilon;[&lambda;<em>y</em> <em>y</em>+2<sup>2</sup>=5] &equiv;
&forall;<em>x</em>([&lambda;<em>y</em> <em>y</em>+4=5]<em>x</em>
&equiv; [&lambda;<em>y</em>
<em>y</em>+2<sup>2</sup>=5]<em>x</em>)</blockquote>

<p>This simply asserts that the extension of the concept <em>that which
added to</em> 4 <em>yields</em> 5 is identical to the extension of the
concept <em>that which added to</em> 2<sup>2</sup> <em>yields</em> 5 if
and only if all and only the objects that when added to 4 yield 5 are
objects that when added to 2<sup>2</sup> yield 5. </p>

<p>

It is worth noting that Basic Law V immediately implies the Existence
of Extensions principle, though as we shall see below, Law V goes
further by constraining this correlation in various ways.  To see that
the Existence of Extensions principle is derivable from Basic Law
V, note that we may instantiate the variable <em>G</em> in Law V
to <em>F</em>, to get &epsilon;<em>F</em> = &epsilon;<em>F</em>
&equiv; &forall;<em>x</em>(<em>Fx</em> &equiv; <em>Fx</em>). But the
right side of this instance of Law V can be derived by logic alone,
and so the left side, the identity &epsilon;<em>F</em> =
&epsilon;<em>F</em>, is again derivable, thereby yielding the
principle as described above.</p>

<p>
There are two important corollaries to Law V that play a role in what
follows: the Law of Extensions and the Principle of
Extensionality. The Law of Extensions (cf. <strong>Gg I</strong>,
&sect;55, Theorem 1) asserts that an object is a member of the
extension of a concept if and only if it falls under that concept:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p><strong>Law of Extensions</strong>:
<br></br>
 &forall;<em>F</em>&forall;<em>x</em>(<em>x</em> &isin;
&epsilon;<em>F</em> &equiv; <em>Fx</em>) </p>

<p>

 (<a href="proof2.html" name="return-pf2">Proof of the Law of Extensions</a>)
 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basic Law V also correctly implies the Principle of Extensionality.
This principle asserts that if two extensions have the same members,
they are identical. If we define
&lsquo;<em>Extension</em>(<em>x</em>)&rsquo; as
&lsquo;&exist;<em>F</em>(<em>x</em>=&epsilon;<em>F</em>)&rsquo; then we
may formally represent and derive the principle of extensionality as
follows: </p>

<blockquote>
 <p> <strong>Principle of Extensionality</strong>:
<br></br>
 <em>Extension</em>(<em>x</em>) &amp;amp; <em>Extension</em>(<em>y</em>)
&rarr; <br></br>
 &Scaron; &Scaron; [&forall;<em>z</em>(<em>z</em> &isin; <em>x</em>
&equiv; <em>z</em> &isin; <em>y</em>) &Scaron; &rarr; &Scaron; <em>x</em> =
<em>y</em>] </p>

 <p>

 (<a href="proof3.html" name="return-pf3">Proof of the Principle of Extensionality</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These above facts about Basic Law V and Frege&apos;s classical logic
puts us in a position to see why Basic Law V can&apos;t be consistently
added to the system. In the following subsections, we shall show how
Basic Law V proves to be inconsistent with the rest of Frege&apos;s
second-order logic and theory of concepts. The proofs depend directly
on the principles and definitions introduced above.  Frege was made
aware of the inconsistency by Bertrand Russell, who sent him a letter
formulating &lsquo;Russell&apos;s Paradox&rsquo; just as the second volume
of <strong>Gg</strong> was going to press. Frege quickly added an
Appendix to the second volume, describing two distinct ways of
deriving a contradiction from Basic Law V. The first establishes the
contradiction directly, without any special definitions. The second
deploys the membership relation and more closely follows Russell&apos;s
Paradox. We will examine both derivations of the contradiction in what
follows. The combination of Frege&apos;s Rule of Substitution (which
ensures that there is a concept corresponding to every formula with
free variable <em>x</em>), the Existence of Extensions principle
(which ensures every concept is correlated with an extension), and
Basic Law V (which ensures that the correlation of concepts with
extensions behaves in a certain way), turns out to be a volatile
mix.</p>

<h3><a name="2.5">2.5 First Derivation of the Contradiction</a></h3>

<p>In the Appendix to <strong>Gg II</strong>, Frege shows that a
contradiction can be derived once we formulate the concept <em>being
an object <em>x</em> which is the extension of some concept which <em>x</em>
doesn&apos;t fall under</em>. We may use the following &lambda;-expression to
name this concept: </p>

<blockquote>
 [&lambda;<em>x</em>
&exist;<em>F</em>(<em>x</em>=&epsilon;<em>F</em> &amp;amp;
&not;<em>Fx</em>)]</blockquote>

<p>We know that there exists such a concept, since the open formula
bound by &lambda;<em>x</em> can be used in the Comprehension Principle
for Concepts (or by the fact that the above &lambda; expression can be
used in Frege&apos;s Rule of Substitution). Now by the Existence of
Extensions principle, the following concept exists and is correlated
with it: </p>

<blockquote>
 &epsilon;[&lambda;<em>x</em>
&exist;<em>F</em>(<em>x</em>=&epsilon;<em>F</em> &amp;amp;
&not;<em>Fx</em>)]</blockquote>

<p>It can now be proved that this extension falls under the concept
[&lambda;<em>x</em> &exist;<em>F</em>(<em>x</em>=&epsilon;<em>F</em>
&amp;amp; &not;<em>Fx</em>)] if and only if it does not. </p>

<blockquote>
 (<a href="proof1.html" name="return-pf1">First Derivation of the Contradiction</a>.)</blockquote>

<h3><a name="2.6">2.6 Second Derivation of the Contradiction</a></h3>

<p>Frege next (in the Appendix to <strong>Gg II</strong>) explained
how Basic Law V implies the Naive Comprehension Axiom for extensions
or sets, which Russell&apos;s Paradox shows to be inconsistent. From the
Law of Extensions (which was derived from Basic Law V above), one can
establish the Naive Comprehension Axiom for extensions in three simple
steps. First we instantiate the Law of Extensions to the free
variable <em>F</em>, to yield: </p>

<blockquote>
 &forall;<em>x</em>(<em>x</em> &isin; &epsilon;<em>F</em>
&equiv; <em>Fx</em>)</blockquote>

<p>By existentially generalizing on &epsilon;<em>F</em>, it follows
that: </p>

<blockquote>
 &exist;<em>y</em>&forall;<em>x</em>(<em>x</em> &isin;
<em>y</em> &equiv; <em>Fx</em>)</blockquote>

<p>Now at this point, we may universally generalize on the variable
<em>F</em> to get the following second-order Naive Comprehension Axiom
for extensions, which asserts that for every concept <em>F</em>, there
is an extension which has as members all and only the objects that fall
under <em>F</em>: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Naive Comprehension Axiom for Extensions</strong>:
<br></br>
 &forall;<em>F</em>&exist;<em>y</em>&forall;<em>x</em>(<em>x</em>
&isin; <em>y</em> &equiv; <em>Fx</em>)</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, instead of generalizing, we could have appealed to
Frege&apos;s Rule of Substitution to show that all of the instances of the
following Naive Comprehension Schema for extensions are derivable in
Frege&apos;s system: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Naive Comprehension Schema for Extensions</strong>:
<br></br>
&exist;<em>y</em>&forall;<em>x</em>(<em>x</em> &isin; <em>y</em>
&equiv; &phi;(<em>x</em>)), where &phi;(<em>x</em>) is any formula in
which <em>x</em> is free and which contains no free occurrences of
<em>y</em></blockquote>

<p>This asserts that for any formula &phi;(<em>x</em>) defining a
condition on objects, there is an extension which has as members all
and only the objects that meet the condition. </p>

<p>

Both the Naive Comprehension Axiom and the Naive Comprehension Schema
immediately give rise to Russell&apos;s Paradox in the context of Frege&apos;s
logic. In the case of the axiom, the contradiction follows by
instantiating the quantified variable <em>F</em> to the concept
[&lambda;<em>z</em>
&not;(<em>z</em>&thinsp;&isin;&thinsp;<em>z</em>)]. In the case of the
schema, the contradiction follows by taking &phi;(<em>x</em>) to be
&not;(<em>x</em>&Scaron;&isin;&Scaron;<em>x</em>), as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
 &exist;<em>y</em>&forall;<em>x</em>(<em>x</em> &isin;
<em>y</em> &equiv; &not;(<em>x</em> &isin; <em>x</em>))</blockquote>

<p>In either case, the proof of the contradiction goes through. The
derivation of the contradiction from the above instance of the schema
is particularly easy. For suppose the object <em>b</em> is such a
<em>y</em>. Then: </p>

<blockquote>
 &forall;<em>x</em>(<em>x</em> &isin; <em>b</em> &equiv;
&not;(<em>x</em> &isin; <em>x</em>))</blockquote>

<p>But we can now instantiate the universal claim to the object <em>b</em>
to yield the following contradiction: </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>b</em> &isin; <em>b</em> &equiv; &not;(<em>b</em>

<h3><a name="2.7">2.7 How the Paradox is Engendered</a></h3>

<p>Philosophers have diagnosed the inconsistency in Frege&apos;s system in
various ways, and it is safe to say that the matter is still somewhat
controversial. In this subsection, we discuss only the basic
elements of the problem. Most philosophers and logicians agree that
the reason Frege&apos;s second-order logic and theory of extensions is
inconsistent is that they jointly require the impossible situation in
which the domain of concepts has to be strictly larger than the domain
of extensions while at the same time the domain of extensions has to
be as large as the domain of concepts. This impossible situation is
strikingly analogous to the impossible situation set up in the proof
by <em>reductio</em> of Cantor&apos;s Theorem (Cantor&apos;s Theorem asserts
that if <em>A</em> is any set, and <em>B</em> is the power set
of <em>A</em> (i.e., <em>B</em> is the set of all subsets
of <em>A</em>), then <em>B</em> has more members than <em>A</em>; the
proof by reductio shows that it is impossible for there to be a
function from <em>A</em> <em>onto</em> <em>B</em>). </p>

<p>

To analyze the inconsistency in Frege&apos;s system in more detail, it is
important to discuss the conditions under which concepts are to be
identified. Although Frege did not believe that statements of the form
&lsquo;<em>F</em> = <em>G</em>&rsquo; were meaningful, it is evident
from the study of <strong>Gg</strong> that the material equivalence of
concepts <em>F</em> and <em>G</em> serves as the proxy identity
conditions of <em>F</em> and <em>G</em>. So, whenever it is
<em>not</em> the case that all and only the objects that fall under
<em>F</em> fall under <em>G</em>, <em>F</em> and <em>G</em> are
distinct concepts.</p>

<p>

With this in mind, we can see how the paradox is engendered. Recall
first that the Existence of Extensions principle correlates each
concept <em>F</em> with an extension &epsilon;<em>F</em>. Each
direction of Basic Law V requires that this correlation have certain
properties. We shall see, for example, that the right-to-left
direction of Basic Law V (i.e., Va) requires that no concept gets
correlated with two distinct extensions. [Frege uses the label
&lsquo;Va&rsquo; to designate the right-to-left direction of Basic Law
V. See, for example, <strong>Gg I</strong>, &sect;52. However, many
commentators use &lsquo;Va&rsquo; to designate the left-to-right
direction. We shall follow Frege&apos;s use, since that will make sense of
his Appendix to <strong>Gg II</strong>, in which he discusses the
paradoxes.] Va asserts:</p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Basic Law Va</strong>:
<br></br>
 &forall;<em>x</em>(<em>Fx</em> &equiv; <em>Gx</em>) &rarr;
&epsilon;<em>F</em> = &epsilon;<em>G</em></blockquote>

<p>If we think in terms of its contraposition and remember the identity
conditions for concepts, Va in effect asserts that whenever extensions
differ, the concepts with which they are correlated differ. This means
that the correlation between concepts and extensions that Basic Law V
sets up must be a function&mdash;no concept gets correlated with two
distinct extensions (though for all Va tells us, distinct concepts
might get correlated with the same extension). Frege noted (in the
Appendix to <strong>Gg II</strong>) that this direction of Basic Law V
doesn&apos;t seem problematic. </p>

<p>

However, the left-to-right direction of Basic Law V (i.e., Vb) is
more serious. Vb asserts:</p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Basic Law Vb</strong>:
<br></br>
 &epsilon;<em>F</em> = &epsilon;<em>G</em> &rarr;
&forall;<em>x</em>(<em>Fx</em> &equiv; <em>Gx</em>)</blockquote>

<p> If we consider the contrapositive of this and remember the identity
conditions for concepts, then Vb, in effect, asserts that whenever the
concepts <em>F</em> and <em>G</em> differ, the extensions of <em>F</em>
and <em>G</em> differ. So, the correlation that Basic Law V sets up
between concepts and extensions will have to be one-to-one; i.e., it
correlates distinct concepts with distinct extensions. Since every
concept is correlated with some extension, there have to be at least as
many extensions as there are concepts. </p>

<p>

But the problem is that Frege&apos;s system <em>as a whole</em> requires
that there be <em>more</em> concepts than extensions. The requirement
that there be more concepts than extensions is imposed jointly by the
Comprehension Principle for Concepts <em>and</em> the new significance
this principle takes on in the presence of Basic Law V. The
Comprehension Principle for Concepts asserts the existence of a
concept for every condition on objects expressible in the
language. Now although it may seem that this principle, in and of
itself, forces the domain of concepts to be larger than the domain of
objects, it is a model-theoretic fact that there are models of
second-order logic with the Comprehension Principle for Concepts (but
without Basic Law V) in which the domain of concepts is not
larger than the domain of
 objects.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup>
 However, the Comprehension
Principle for Concepts takes on new significance when Basic Law V is
added to Frege&apos;s system. The synergism of the Comprehension Principle
for Concepts and Basic Law V force the domain of concepts to be larger
than the domain of objects (and so larger than the domain of
extensions). However, as we saw in the last paragraph, Vb requires that
there be at least as many extensions as there are concepts.</p>

<p>

Thus, Frege&apos;s second-order logic and theory of extensions together
required the impossible situation in which the domain of concepts has
to be strictly larger than the domain of extensions while at the same
time the domain of extensions has to be as large as the domain of
concepts.</p>

<p>

Recently, there has been a lot of interest in discovering ways of
repairing Frege&apos;s system. The traditional view is that one must either
restrict Basic Law V or restrict the Comprehension Principle for
Concepts. Recently, Boolos (1986, 1993) developed one of the more
interesting suggestions for revising Basic Law V without abandoning
second-order logic and its comprehension principle for concepts. On
the other hand, there have been many suggestions for restricting the
Comprehension Principle for Concepts. The most severe of these is to
abandon second-order logic (and the Comprehension Principle for
Concepts) altogether. Schroeder-Heister (1987) conjectured that the
first-order portion of Frege&apos;s system (i.e., the system which results
by adding Basic Law V to the first-order predicate calculus) was
consistent and this was proved by T. Parsons (1987) and Burgess
(1998).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup> Heck
(1996), Wehmeier (1999), and Ferreira (2005) consider less drastic
moves. They investigate systems of second-order logic which have been
extended by Basic Law V but in which the Comprehension Principle for
Concepts is restricted in some way.  See also Anderson &amp;amp; Zalta
(2004) and Antonelli &amp;amp; May (2005) for different approaches to
repairing Frege&apos;s system. See Fine (2002) for a discussion of the
limits of Frege&apos;s method and see Burgess (2005) for a good general
overview.</p>

<p>
 We will not discuss the above research further in the present entry,
for it is not clear which of their alternatives, or others, would have
been acceptable to Frege. Instead, we focus on the theoretical
accomplishment revealed by Frege&apos;s work in <strong>Gg</strong>.</p>

<p>

Despite the failure of Basic Law V, Frege validly proved a rather
deep fact about the natural numbers, namely, that the Dedekind/Peano
axioms for number theory could be derived in second-order logic with
the help of a single additional principle. The principle in question is
known as Hume&apos;s Principle (discussed below). Although both C. Parsons
(1965) and Wright (1983) had recently noted that Hume&apos;s Principle was
powerful enough for the derivation of the Dedekind/Peano axioms, Heck
(1993) showed that although Frege did use Basic Law V to derive Hume&apos;s
principle, his (Frege&apos;s) subsequent derivations of the Dedekind/Peano
axioms of number theory from Hume&apos;s Principle never made an
<em>essential</em> appeal to Basic Law V. Since Hume&apos;s Principle can
be consistently added to second-order logic, we may conclude that
Frege himself validly derived the basic laws of number theory. It will
be the task of the next few sections to explain Frege&apos;s
accomplishments in this regard. We will do this in two stages. In
&sect;3 we study Frege&apos;s attempt to derive Hume&apos;s Principle from Basic
Law V by analyzing cardinal numbers as extensions. Then, we put this
aside in &sect;&sect;4 and 5 to examine how Frege was able to derive
the Dedekind/Peano axioms of number theory from Hume&apos;s Principle
alone.</p>

<h2><a name="S3">3. Frege&apos;s Analysis of Cardinal Numbers</a></h2>

<p>

Cardinal numbers are the numbers that can be used to answer the
question &lsquo;How many?&rsquo;, and Frege discovered that such
numbers bear an interesting relationship to the natural numbers.
Frege&apos;s insights concerning this relationship trace back to his work in
<strong>Gl</strong>, in which the notion of an extension played very
little role. The seminal idea of <strong>Gl</strong>, &sect;46, was the
observation that a statement of number (e.g., &ldquo;There are nine planets&rdquo;)
is an assertion about a concept. To explain this idea, Frege noted that
one and the same external phenomenon can be counted in different ways;
for example, a certain external phenomenon could be counted as one
army, 5 divisions, 25 regiments, 120 companies, 400 platoons, or 4000
people. Each different way of counting this phenomenon corresponds to
the manner of its conception. The question &ldquo;How many are there?&rdquo; is
only properly formulated as the question &ldquo;How many <em>F</em>s are
there?&rdquo; where a concept <em>F</em> is supplied. On Frege&apos;s view, the
statements of number which answer such questions (e.g., &ldquo;There are
<em>n</em> <em>F</em>s&rdquo;) tell us something about the concept involved.
For example, the statement &ldquo;There are nine planets in the solar system&rdquo;
tells us that the ordinary, <em>first-level</em> concept <em>planet in
the solar system</em> falls under the <em>second-level</em> numerical
concept <em>concept under which nine objects fall</em>. </p>

<p>

Frege then moves from this realization, in which statements of numbers
are analyzed as predicating second-level numerical concepts of
first-level concepts, to develop an account of the cardinal and
natural numbers as &lsquo;self-subsistent&rsquo; objects. He
introduces a &lsquo;cardinality operator&rsquo; on concepts, namely,
&lsquo;the number belonging to the concept <em>F</em>&rsquo;, which
will designate the cardinal number which numbers the objects falling
under <em>F</em>.  In what follows, we say this more simply as
&lsquo;the number of <em>F</em>s&rsquo; and use the simple notation
&lsquo;#<em>F</em>&rsquo;. (Note that the operator # behaves like
the &epsilon; operator &mdash; when it is prefixed to a name of a concept
(or prefixed to a concept variable), the resulting expression denotes
an object (or ranges over objects).)  Frege offers both an implicit
and an explicit definition of this operator in
<strong>Gl</strong>. Both of these definitions require a preliminary
definition of when two concepts <em>F</em> and <em>G</em> are in
one-to-one correspondence or &lsquo;equinumerous&rsquo;. After
developing the definition of equinumerosity, we then discuss Frege&apos;s
implicit and explicit definition of the number of <em>F</em>s.</p>

<h3><a name="3.1">3.1 Equinumerosity</a></h3>

<p>In order to state the definition of equinumerosity, we shall employ the
well-known logical notion &lsquo;there exists a unique <em>x</em> such
that &phi;(<em>x</em>)&rsquo;. To say that there exists a unique
<em>x</em> such that &phi;(<em>x</em>) is to say: there is some
<em>x</em> such that &phi;(<em>x</em>) and anything <em>y</em> which is
such that &phi;(<em>y</em>/<em>x</em>) is identical to <em>x</em>. In
what follows, we use the notation
&lsquo;&exist;!<em>x</em>&phi;(<em>x</em>)&rsquo; to abbreviate this
notion of unique existence, and we define it formally as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
 &exist;!<em>x</em>&phi;(<em>x</em>) &Scaron; =<sub>df</sub>
&Scaron; &exist;<em>x</em>[&phi;(<em>x</em>) &amp;amp;
&forall;<em>y</em>(&phi;(<em>y</em>/<em>x</em>) &rarr;
<em>y</em>=<em>x</em>)]</blockquote>

<p>Now, in terms of this logical notion of unique existence, we can state
Frege&apos;s definition of equinumerosity (<strong>Gl</strong>, &sect;71,
72) as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>F</em> and <em>G</em> are <em>equinumerous</em> (or,
<em>F</em> and <em>G</em> are in <em>one-to-one correspondence</em>)
just in case there is a relation <em>R</em> such that: (1) every object
falling under <em>F</em> is <em>R</em>-related to a unique object
falling under <em>G</em>, and (2) every object falling under <em>G</em>
is such that there is a unique object falling under <em>F</em> which is
<em>R</em>-related to it.</blockquote>

<p>If we let &lsquo;<em>F</em> &asymp; <em>G</em>&rsquo; stand for
equinumerosity, then the definition of this notion can be rendered
formally as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>F</em> &asymp; <em>G</em> &Scaron; =<sub>df</sub>
<br></br>
 &Scaron; &exist;<em>R</em>[&forall;<em>x</em>(<em>Fx</em> &rarr;
&exist;!<em>y</em>(<em>Gy</em> &amp;amp; <em>Rxy</em>)) &Scaron; &amp;amp; &Scaron;
&forall;<em>x</em>(<em>Gx</em> &rarr; &exist;!<em>y</em>(<em>Fy</em>
&amp;amp; <em>Ryx</em>))]</blockquote>

<p>To see that Frege&apos;s definition of equinumerosity works correctly,
consider the following two examples. In the first example, we have two
concepts that are equinumerous: </p>

<blockquote>
 <img src="1-1.gif" alt="representation of two equinumerous concepts" width="267" height="182"></img>
<br></br>
 <strong>Figure 1</strong></blockquote>

<p>Although there are several different relations <em>R</em> which would
demonstrate the equinumerosity of <em>F</em> and <em>G</em> the
particular relation used in Figure 1 is: </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>R</em><sub>1</sub> = [&lambda;<em>xy</em> (<em>x=a</em>
&amp;amp; <em>y=f</em>) &or; (<em>x=b</em> &amp;amp; <em>y=g</em>) &or; (<em>x=c</em>
&amp;amp; <em>y=e</em>)]</blockquote>

<p>It is a simple exercise to show that <em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, as
defined, is a &lsquo;witness&rsquo; to the equinumerosity of <em>F</em>
and <em>G</em> (according to the definition).</p>

<p>

In the second example, we have two concepts that are not
equinumerous:</p>

<blockquote>
 <img src="not-1-1.gif" alt="graphic of non-equinumerous concepts" width="250" height="170"></img>
<br></br>
 <strong>Figure 2</strong></blockquote>

<p>In this example, no relation <em>R</em> can satisfy the definition of
equinumerosity.</p>

<p>

Clearly, then, the concepts <em>F</em> and <em>G</em> will be
equinumerous whenever the number of objects falling under <em>F</em> is
identical to the number of objects falling under <em>G</em>. This fact
will be codified by Hume&apos;s Principle. Before moving ahead to the
discussion of this principle, the reader should convince him- or
herself of the following four facts: (1) that the material equivalence
of two concepts implies their equinumerosity, (2) that equinumerosity
is reflexive, (3) that equinumerosity is symmetric, and (4) that
equinumerosity is transitive. In formal terms, the following facts are
provable:</p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Facts About Equinumerosity</strong>:
<br></br>
 1. &forall;<em>x</em>(<em>Fx</em> &equiv; <em>Gx</em>) &rarr;
<em>F</em> &asymp; <em>G</em>
<br></br>
 2. <em>F</em> &asymp; <em>F</em>
<br></br>
 3. <em>F</em> &asymp; <em>G</em> &rarr; <em>G</em> &asymp; <em>F</em>
<br></br>
 4. <em>F</em> &asymp; <em>G</em> &amp;amp; <em>G</em> &asymp; <em>H</em>
&rarr; <em>F</em> &asymp; <em>H</em></blockquote>

<p>The proofs of these facts, in each case, require the identification of
a relation that is a witness to the relevant equinumerosity claim. In
some cases, it is easy to identify the relation in question. In other
cases, the reader should be able to &lsquo;construct&rsquo; such
relations (using &lambda;-notation) by considering the examples
described above. Facts (2) &ndash; (4) establish that equinumerosity
is an &lsquo;equivalence relation&rsquo; which divides up the domain
of concepts into &lsquo;equivalence classes&rsquo; of equinumerous
concepts. Material equivalence is also an equivalence relation which
divides up the domain of concepts into equivalence classes of
materially equivalent concepts.</p>

<h3><a name="3.2">3.2 Contextual Definition of &lsquo;The Number of <em>F</em>s&rsquo;: Hume&apos;s Principle</a></h3>

<p>Frege contextually defined &lsquo;the number of <em>F</em>s&rsquo; in
terms of the principle now known as Hume&apos;s
 Principle:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#3" name="note-3">3</a>]</sup></p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Hume&apos;s Principle</strong>:
<br></br>
 The number of <em>F</em>s is identical to the number of <em>G</em>s if
and only if <em>F</em> and <em>G</em> are equinumerous.</blockquote>

<p>Using our notation &lsquo;#<em>F</em>&rsquo; to abbreviate &lsquo;the
number of <em>F</em>s&rsquo;, we may formalize Hume&apos;s Principle as
follows: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Hume&apos;s Principle</strong>:
<br></br>
 #<em>F</em> = #<em>G</em> &Scaron; &equiv; &Scaron; <em>F</em> &asymp;
<em>G</em></blockquote>

<p>This contextual definition governing cardinal numbers is the basic
principle upon which Frege forged his development of the theory of
natural
 numbers.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#4" name="note-4">4</a>]</sup>
 In <strong>Gl</strong>, Frege sketched the
derivations of the basic laws of number theory from Hume&apos;s Principle;
these sketches were developed into more rigorous proofs in <strong>Gg
I</strong>. We will examine these derivations in the following
sections.</p>

<p>

Once Frege had a contextual definition of #<em>F</em>, he then
defined a cardinal number as any object which is the number of some
concept:</p>

<blockquote>
 <em>x is a cardinal number</em> &Scaron; =<sub>df</sub>
&Scaron; &exist;<em>F</em>(<em>x</em> = #<em>F</em>)</blockquote>

<p>This definition appears in <strong>Gl</strong>, &sect;72.</p>

<p>

Notice that Hume&apos;s Principle bears an obvious formal resemblance to
Basic Law V. Both are biconditionals asserting the equivalence of an
identity among singular terms (the left-side condition) with an
equivalence relation on concepts (the right-side condition). Indeed,
both correlate concepts with certain objects. In the case of Hume&apos;s
Principle, each concept <em>F</em> is correlated with #<em>F</em>.
However, whereas Basic Law V problematically asserts that the
correlation between concepts and extensions is one-to-one, Hume&apos;s
Principle only asserts that the correlation between concepts and
numbers is many-to-one. Hume&apos;s Principle often correlates distinct
concepts with the same number. For example, the distinct concepts
<em>author of Principia Mathematica</em> (&lsquo;[&lambda;<em>x</em>
<em>Axp</em>]&rsquo;) and <em>number between</em> 1 <em>and</em> 4
(&lsquo;[&lambda;<em>x</em> 1&amp;lt;<em>x</em>&amp;lt;4]&rsquo;) are
equinumerous (both both have two objects falling under them). So
#[&lambda;<em>x</em> <em>Axp</em>] = #[&lambda;<em>x</em>
1&amp;lt;<em>x</em>&amp;lt;4]. Thus, Hume&apos;s Principle, unlike Basic Law V,
does not require that the domain of numbers be as large as the domain
of concepts. Indeed, several authors have developed models that show
Hume&apos;s Principle can be consistently added to second-order logic.  See
the independent work of Geach (1976, 446&ndash;7), Hodes (1984, 138),
Burgess (1984) and Hazen (1985).</p>

<h3><a name="3.3">3.3 Explicit Definition of &lsquo;The Number of <em>F</em>s&rsquo;</a></h3>

<p>[Note: The remaining two subsections are not strictly necessary for
understanding the proof of Frege&apos;s Theorem. They are included here for
those who wish to have a more complete understanding of what Frege in
fact attempted to do. They presuppose the material in &sect;2. Readers
interested in just the positive aspects of Frege&apos;s accomplishments
should skip directly to &sect;4.]</p>

<p>

Before we examine the powerful consequences that Frege derived from
Hume&apos;s Principle, it is worth digressing to describe his failed attempt
to explicitly define &lsquo;#<em>F</em>&rsquo; and to derive Hume&apos;s
Principle from Basic Law V. The idea behind this attempt was the
realization that if given any concept <em>F</em>, the notion of
equinumerosity can be used to define the second-level concept <em>being
a concept G that is equinumerous to F</em> (&lsquo;<em>G</em> &asymp;
<em>F</em>&rsquo;). Frege found a way to collect all of the concepts
equinumerous to a given concept <em>F</em> into a single extension. In
<strong>Gl</strong>, he informally took this to be an extension
consisting of first-order concepts. In that work, he defined informally
(&sect;68):</p>

<blockquote>
 the number of <em>F</em>s &Scaron; =<sub>df</sub>
<br></br>
 &Scaron; the extension of the second-level concept: <em>being a
first-level concept equinumerous to F</em></blockquote>

<p>In terms of the example used at the end of the previous subsection,
this definition identifies the number of the concept <em>author of
Principia Mathematica</em> as the extension consisting of all and only
those first-level concepts that are equinumerous to this concept; this
extension has both [&lambda;<em>x</em> <em>Axp</em>] and
[&lambda;<em>x</em> 1&amp;lt;x&amp;lt;4] as members. Frege in fact
identifies the cardinal number 2 with this extension, for it contains
all and only those concepts under which two objects fall. Similarly,
Frege identifies the cardinal number 0 with the extension consisting of
all those first-level concepts under which no object falls; this
extension would include such concepts as <em>unicorn</em>,
<em>centaur</em>, <em>prime number between</em> 3 <em>and</em> 5, etc.
Frege&apos;s insight here inspired Russell to develop a somewhat similar
definition in his work, and it is now common to see references to the
so-called &ldquo;Frege-Russell definition of the cardinal numbers&rdquo; as classes
of equinumerous concepts or
 sets.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#5" name="note-5">5</a>]</sup>
 Of course, this explicit definition of &lsquo;the
number of <em>F</em>s&rsquo; stands or falls with a coherent conception
of &lsquo;extension&rsquo;. We know that Basic Law V does not offer
such a coherent conception. </p>

<h3><a name="3.4">3.4 Derivation of Hume&apos;s Principle</a></h3>

<p>Frege&apos;s derivation of Hume&apos;s Principle was invalidated by the fact that
it appeals to the inconsistent Basic Law V. Nevertheless, it is
instructive to consider why Frege thought the derivation was valid. In
<strong>Gl</strong>, &sect;73, Frege sketches an informal proof of the
right-to-left direction of Hume&apos;s Principle using the above explicit
definition of the number of <em>F</em>s. The derivation appeals to the
fact that a concept <em>G</em> is a member of the extension of the
second-level concept <em>concept equinumerous to F</em> if and only if
<em>G</em> is equinumerous to <em>F</em>. In other words, the proof
relies on a kind of higher-order version of the Law of Extensions
(described above), the ordinary version of which we know to be a
consequence of Basic Law
 V.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#6" name="note-6">6</a>]</sup>
 Here is a reconstruction of Frege&apos;s proof in
<strong>Gl</strong>, &sect;73, extended so as to cover both directions
of Hume&apos;s Principle. </p>

<blockquote>
 <a href="Gl-Hume.html" name="return-glhume">Frege&apos;s Derivation of Hume&apos;s Principle in the <em>Grundlagen</em></a></blockquote>

<p>However, in the development of <strong>Gg</strong>, Fregean extensions
do <em>not</em> contain concepts as members but rather objects. So
Frege had to find another way to express the explicit definition
described in the previous subsection. His technique was to let
extensions go proxy for their corresponding concepts. Since a full
explanation of this technique and the proof of Hume&apos;s Principle in
<strong>Gg</strong> would constitute a digression for the present
exposition, we shall describe the details for interested readers on a
separate page: </p>

<blockquote>
 <a href="Gg-Hume.html" name="return-gghume">Frege&apos;s &lsquo;Derivation&rsquo; of Hume&apos;s Principle in the <em>Grundgesetze</em></a></blockquote>

<p>As noted on several occasions, the inconsistency in Basic Law V
invalidated Frege&apos;s derivation of Hume&apos;s Principle. But Hume&apos;s
Principle, in and of itself, is a powerful and consistent principle.</p>

<h2><a name="S4">4. Frege&apos;s Analysis of Predecessor, Ancestrals, and the Natural Numbers</a></h2>

<p>In what follows, we shall suppose that Hume&apos;s Principle has replaced
Basic Law V in Frege&apos;s second-order system. This requires that we
replace the operator &ldquo;the course of values of the function <em>f</em>&rdquo;
(and &ldquo;the extension of concept <em>F</em>&rdquo;) with the primitive operator
&ldquo;the number of <i>F</i>s&rdquo;. As we have mentioned, Frege made the insightful
discovery that the basic laws of number theory could be derived from
Hume&apos;s Principle alone. This is Frege&apos;s Theorem. In this section, we
introduce the definitions required for the proof of Frege&apos;s Theorem. In
the next section, we go through the proof. In the final section, we
conclude with a discussion of the philosophical questions that arise
when we consider Hume&apos;s Principle as a replacement for Basic Law V.</p>

<p>

The insight behind Frege&apos;s analysis of the natural numbers was the
realization that one can define the finite cardinal numbers in terms of
the following concepts:</p>

<blockquote>
 C<sub>0</sub> = [&lambda;<em>x</em> &Scaron;
<em>x</em>&ne;<em>x</em>]
<br></br>
 C<sub>1</sub> = [&lambda;<em>x</em> &Scaron; <em>x</em> =
#C<sub>0</sub>]
<br></br>
 C<sub>2</sub> = [&lambda;<em>x</em> &Scaron; <em>x</em> = #C<sub>0</sub>
&Scaron; &or; &Scaron; <em>x</em> = #C<sub>1</sub>]
<br></br>
 C<sub>3</sub> = [&lambda;<em>x</em> &Scaron; <em>x</em> = #C<sub>0</sub>
&Scaron; &or; &Scaron; <em>x</em> = #C<sub>1</sub> &Scaron; &or; &Scaron; <em>x</em>
= #C<sub>2</sub>]
<br></br>
 etc.</blockquote>

<p>Note that starting with C<sub>1</sub>, each concept
C<sub><em>k</em></sub> has the following property: all and only the
numbers of concepts preceding C<sub><em>k</em></sub> in the sequence
fall under C<sub><em>k</em></sub>. So, for example, the concepts
preceding C<sub>3</sub> are C<sub>0</sub>, C<sub>1</sub>, and
C<sub>2</sub>. Accordingly, all and only the following numbers fall
under C<sub>3</sub>: #C<sub>0</sub>, #C<sub>1</sub>, and
#C<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>

Frege noticed that these concepts can be used, respectively, to
define the the finite cardinal numbers, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
 0 = #C<sub>0</sub>
<br></br>
 1 = #C<sub>1</sub>
<br></br>
 2 = #C<sub>2</sub>
<br></br>
 etc.</blockquote>

<p>This insight, however, was only the first step in Frege&apos;s plan. He
realized that though this seems to define a sequence of numbers with
which we can identify the natural numbers, we have not as yet defined
the concept &lsquo;natural number&rsquo; so that it applies to all and
only the cardinal numbers defined in the second sequence. Such a
concept is required if we are to prove <em>as theorems</em> the
following axioms of Dedekind/Peano number theory: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Dedekind/Peano Axioms for Number Theory</strong>:

<ul>
<li>0 is a natural number.</li>

<li>0 is not the successor of any natural number.</li>

<li>No two natural numbers have the same successor.</li>

<li>If both (a) 0 falls under <em>F</em>, and (b) for any two natural
numbers <em>n</em> and <em>m</em> such that <em>m</em> is the successor
of <em>n</em>, the fact that <em>n</em> falls under <em>F</em> implies
that <em>m</em> falls under <em>F</em>, then every natural number falls
under <em>F</em>. (Principle of Induction)</li>

<li>Every natural number has a successor.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Moreover, Frege recognized the need to employ the Principle of
Induction in the proof that every number has a successor. One cannot
prove the claim that <em>every number has a successor</em> simply by
producing the sequence of expressions for cardinal numbers (e.g., the
second of the two sequences described above). All such a sequence
demonstrates is that for every expression listed in the sequence, one
can define an expression of the appropriate form to follow it in the
sequence. This is <em>not</em> the same as proving that <em>every
natural number</em> has a successor.</p>

<h3><a name="4.1">4.1 Predecessor</a></h3>

<p>To accomplish these further goals, Frege proceeded by defining the
concept <em>x</em> (<em>immediately</em>) <em>precedes y</em> as
follows (<strong>Gl</strong>, &sect;76, and <strong>Gg I</strong>,
&sect;43): </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>x</em> (<em>immediately</em>) <em>precedes</em>
<em>y</em> if and only if there is a concept <em>F</em> and an object
<em>w</em> such that: (a) <em>w</em> falls under <em>F</em>, (b)
<em>y</em> is the number of <em>F</em>s, and (c) <em>x</em> is the
number of the concept <em>object falling under F other than
w</em></blockquote>

<p>In formal terms, the definition takes the following form: </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>Precedes</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) &Scaron;
=<sub>df</sub>
<br></br>
 &Scaron; &exist;<em>F</em>&exist;<em>w</em>(<em>Fw</em> &thinsp;&amp;amp;&thinsp;
 y=#<em>F</em> &thinsp;&amp;amp;&thinsp;
 <em>x</em>=#[&lambda;<em>z</em> <em>Fz</em> &amp;amp;
<em>z</em>&ne;<em>w</em>])</blockquote>

<p>Even though we can&apos;t as yet assume that we have defined the natural
numbers 1 and 2, we can use them intuitively to show that the
definition properly predicts that <em>Precedes</em>(1,2) if given
certain facts about the numbers of certain concepts. Let the expression
&lsquo;[&lambda;<em>z</em> <em>Azp</em>]&rsquo; denote the concept
<em>author of Principia Mathematica</em>. Only Bertrand Russell
(&lsquo;<em>r</em>&rsquo;) and Alfred Whitehead fall under this
concept. Let the expression &lsquo;[&lambda;<em>z</em> <em>Azp</em>
&amp;amp; <em>z</em>&ne;<em>r</em>]&rsquo; denote the concept <em>author of
Principia Mathematica other than
 Russell</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#7" name="note-7">7</a>]</sup>
 Then the following may, for
the purposes of this example, be taken as facts: </p>

<ul>
<li>Russell falls under the concept <em>author of Principia
Mathematica</em>, i.e.,
<br></br>
 &Scaron; [&lambda;<em>z</em> <em>Azp</em>]<em>r</em></li>

<li>2 is the number of the concept <em>author of Principia
Mathematica</em>, i.e.,
<br></br>
 &Scaron; 2 = #[&lambda;<em>z</em> <em>Azp</em>]</li>

<li>1 is the number of the concept <em>author of Principia Mathematica
other than Russell</em>, i.e.,
<br></br>
 &Scaron; 1 = #[&lambda;<em>z</em> <em>Azp</em> &amp;amp;
<em>z</em>&ne;<em>r</em>]</li>
</ul>

<p>

If we assemble these truths into a conjunction and apply existential
generalization in the appropriate places, the result is the definiens
of the definition of predecessor instantiated to the numbers 1 and 2.
Thus, if given certain facts about the number of objects falling under
the certain concepts, the definition of predecessor correctly predicts
that <em>Precedes</em>(1,2). </p>

<h3><a name="4.2">4.2 The Ancestral of Relation <em>R</em></a></h3>

<p>Frege next defines the relational concept <em>x is an ancestor of y
in the R-series</em>. This new relation is called &lsquo;the ancestral
of the relation <em>R</em>&rsquo; and we henceforth designate this
relation as <em>R</em>*. Frege first defined the ancestral of relation
<em>R</em> in <strong>Begr</strong> (Part III, Proposition 76), though
the word &lsquo;ancestral&rsquo; comes to us from Russell and
Whitehead. Frege&apos;s term for the ancestral is &ldquo;<em>x</em> comes before
<em>y</em> in the <em>R</em>-series&rdquo;; alternatively, &ldquo;<em>y</em>
follows <em>x</em> in the <em>R</em>-series&rdquo;. (See also
<strong>Gl</strong>, &sect;79 and <strong>Gg I</strong>, &sect;45.) The
intuitive idea is easily grasped if we consider the relation <em>x</em>
is the father of <em>y</em>. Suppose that <em>a</em> is the father of
<em>b</em>, that <em>b</em> is the father of <em>c</em>, and that
<em>c</em> is the father of <em>d</em>. Then &lsquo;<em>x</em> is an
ancestor of <em>y</em> in the fatherhood-series&rsquo; is defined so
that <em>a</em> is an ancestor of <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, and
<em>d</em>, that <em>b</em> is an ancestor of <em>c</em> and
<em>d</em>, and that <em>c</em> is an ancestor of <em>d</em>.</p>

<p>

Frege&apos;s definition of the ancestral of <em>R</em> requires a
preliminary definition:</p>

<blockquote>
 <em>the concept F is hereditary in the R-series</em> if and
only if any pair of <em>R</em>-related objects <em>x</em> and
<em>y</em> are such that <em>y</em> falls under <em>F</em> whenever
<em>x</em> falls under <em>F</em></blockquote>

<p>In formal terms: </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>Her</em>(<em>F</em>,<em>R</em>) &Scaron; =<sub>abbr</sub>
&Scaron; &forall;<em>x</em>&forall;<em>y</em>(<em>Rxy</em> &rarr; (<em>Fx</em>
&rarr; <em>Fy</em>))</blockquote>

<p>Intuitively, the idea is that <em>F</em> is hereditary in the
<em>R</em>-series if <em>F</em> is always &lsquo;passed&rsquo; from
<em>x</em> to <em>y</em> whenever <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are a pair
of <em>R</em>-related objects. (We warn the reader here that the
notation &lsquo;<em>Her</em>(<em>F</em>,<em>R</em>)&rsquo; is merely an
abbreviation of a much longer statement. It is <em>not</em> a formula
of our language having the form
&lsquo;<em>R</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)&rsquo;. In what follows, we
sometimes introduce other such abbreviations.) </p>

<p>

Frege&apos;s definition of the ancestral of <em>R</em> can now be stated
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
 <em>x comes before y in the R-series</em> &Scaron;
=<sub>df</sub> &Scaron; <em>y</em> falls under all those
<em>R</em>-hereditary concepts <em>F</em> under which falls every
object to which <em>x</em> is <em>R</em>-related</blockquote>

<p>In other words, <em>y</em> follows <em>x</em> in the <em>R</em>-series
whenever <em>y</em> falls under every hereditary concept <em>F</em>
which <em>x</em> &lsquo;passes on&rsquo; to all of its immediate
descendants. In formal terms: </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>R</em>*(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) &Scaron; =<sub>df</sub>
&Scaron; &forall;<em>F</em>[&forall;<em>z</em>(<em>Rxz</em> &rarr;
<em>Fz</em>) &Scaron; &amp;amp; &Scaron; <em>Her</em>(<em>F</em>,<em>R</em>)
&Scaron; &rarr; &Scaron; <em>Fy</em>]</blockquote>

<p>For example, Clinton&apos;s father stands in relation <em>father* of</em>
(i.e., <em>forefather</em>) to Chelsea because she falls under every
hereditary concept that Clinton and his brother inherited from
Clinton&apos;s father. However, Clinton&apos;s brother is not one of Chelsea&apos;s
forefathers, since he fails to be her father, her grandfather, or any
of the other links in the chain of fathers from which Chelsea
descended.</p>

<p>

It is important to grasp the differences between a relation
<em>R</em> and its ancestral <em>R</em>*. <em>Rxy</em> implies
<em>R</em>*(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) (e.g., if Clinton is a father of
Chelsea, then Clinton is a forefather of Chelsea), but the converse
doesn&apos;t hold (Clinton&apos;s father is a father* of Chelsea, but he is not a
father of Chelsea). Indeed, a grasp of the definition of <em>R</em>*
should leave one able to prove the following easy consequences, many of
which correspond to theorems in <strong>Begr</strong> and
 <strong>Gg</strong>:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#8" name="note-8">8</a>]</sup></p>

<li><em>R</em>*(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) &amp;amp;
<em>R</em>*(<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>) &rarr;
<em>R</em>*(<em>x</em>,<em>z</em>)</li>
</ol>

<p>

The reader should consider what happens when <em>R</em> is taken to be
the relation <em>precedes</em>. Appealing to our intuitive grasp of the
numbers, we can say that it is an instance of Fact (1) that if 10
precedes 12, then 10 precedes* 12; and that it is an instance of Fact
(2) that 10&apos;s preceding* 12 does not imply that 10 precedes 12. An
instance of Fact (7) is that precedes* is transitive. When we restrict
ourselves to the natural numbers, it is intuitive to think of the
difference between precedes and precedes* as the difference between
<em>immediately precedes</em> and <em>less-than</em>. </p>

<h3><a name="4.3">4.3 The Weak Ancestral of <em>R</em></a></h3>

<p>Given the notion of the ancestral of relation <em>R</em>, Frege then
defines its weak ancestral, which he termed &ldquo;<em>y is a member of the
R-series beginning with x</em>&rdquo; (cf. <strong>Begr</strong>, Part III,
Proposition 99; <strong>Gl</strong>, &sect;81, and <strong>Gg
I</strong>, &sect;46): </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>y is a member of the R-series beginning with x</em> if
and only if either <em>x</em> bears the ancestral of <em>R</em> to
<em>y</em> or <em>x</em> = <em>y</em></blockquote>

<p>In formal terms: </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>R</em><sup>+</sup>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) &Scaron;
=<sub>df</sub> &Scaron; <em>R</em>*(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) &or;
<em>x</em>=<em>y</em></blockquote>

<p>We note here that Frege would also read
<em>R</em><sup>+</sup>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) as: <em>x</em> is a
member of the <em>R</em>-series ending with <em>y</em>! Logicians call
<em>R</em><sup>+</sup> the &lsquo;weak-ancestral&rsquo; of <em>R</em>
because it is a weakened version of <em>R</em>*. When <em>R</em> is
<em>precedes</em>, we can intuitively regard its weak ancestral,
<em>precedes</em><sup>+</sup>, as the relation
<em>less-than-or-equal-to</em> on the natural numbers. </p>

<p>

The general definition of the weak ancestral of <em>R</em> yields
the following facts, many of which correspond to theorems in

<h3><a name="4.4">4.4 The Concept <em>Natural Number</em></a></h3>

<p>Frege&apos;s definition of <em>natural number</em> requires one more
preliminary definition. It may be recalled that Frege identified
the number 0 as the (cardinal) number of the concept <em>being
non-self-identical</em>. That is: </p>

<blockquote>
 0 &Scaron; =<sub>df</sub> &Scaron; #[&lambda;<em>x</em>
<em>x</em>&ne;<em>x</em>]</blockquote>

<p>Since the logic of identity guarantees that no object fails to be
self-identical, nothing falls under the concept <em>being
non-self-identical</em>. Had one of Frege&apos;s explicit definitions of the
cardinal numbers worked as he had intended, the number 0 would, in
effect, be identified with the extension of all (extensions of)
concepts under which nothing falls. However, for the present purposes,
we may note that 0 is defined in terms of the primitive notion
&lsquo;the number of <em>F</em>s&rsquo; and a particular complex
concept the existence of which is guaranteed in Frege&apos;s theory of
concepts and second-order logic with identity. It is straightforward to
prove the following Lemma Concerning Zero from this definition of 0: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Lemma Concerning Zero</strong>:
<br></br>
 #<em>F</em> = 0 &equiv; &not;&exist;<em>xFx</em>

<p>

 (<a href="proof4.html" name="return-pf4">Proof of Lemma Concerning Zero</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that the proof appeals to Hume&apos;s Principle and facts about
equinumerosity.</p>

<p>

Frege&apos;s definition of the concept <em>natural number</em> can now be
stated in terms of the weak-ancestral of Predecessor:</p>

<blockquote>
 <em>x is a natural number</em> if and only if <em>x</em> is
a member of the predecessor-series beginning with 0</blockquote>

<p>This definition appears in <strong>Gl</strong>, &sect;83, and
<strong>Gg I</strong>, &sect;46 as the definition of &lsquo;finite
number&rsquo;. Indeed, the natural numbers are precisely the finite
cardinals. In formal terms, Frege&apos;s definition becomes: </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>N</em><em>x</em> &Scaron; =<sub>df</sub> &Scaron;
<em>Precedes</em><sup>+</sup>(0,<em>x</em>)</blockquote>

<p>In what follows, we shall sometimes use the variables <em>m</em>,
<em>n</em>, and <em>o</em> to range over the natural numbers. </p>

<h2><a name="S5">5. Frege&apos;s Theorem</a></h2>

<p>

Frege&apos;s Theorem is that the five Dedekind/Peano axioms for number
theory can be derived from Hume&apos;s Principle in second-order logic. In
this section, we reconstruct the proof of this theorem which can be
extracted from Frege&apos;s work using the definitions and theorems
assembled so far. Some of the steps in this proof can be found in
<strong>Gl</strong>. (See the Appendix to Boolos (1990) for a
reconstruction.) Our reconstruction follows Frege&apos;s <strong>Gg</strong>
in spirit and in most details, but we have tried to simplify the
presentation in several places. For a more strict description of
Frege&apos;s <strong>Gg</strong> proof, the reader is referred to Heck
(1993). The following should help prepare the reader for Heck&apos;s
excellent essay.</p>

<h3><a name="5.1">5.1 Zero is a Number</a></h3>

<p>The following is an immediate consequence of the definition of
<em>natural number</em>: </p>

<blockquote>
 <p>
 <strong>Theorem 1</strong>:
<br></br>
 <em>N</em>0 </p>

  <p>

<em>Proof</em>: It is a simple consequence of the definition of
&lsquo;weak ancestral&rsquo; that <em>R</em><sup>+</sup> is reflexive
(see Fact 4 about <em>R</em><sup>+</sup> in our subsection on the Weak
Ancestral in &sect;4). So <em>Precedes</em><sup>+</sup>(0,0). Hence, by
the definition of number, 0 is a number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems that Frege never actually identified this fact explicitly in
<strong>Gl</strong> or labeled this fact as a numbered Theorem in
<strong>Gg I</strong>. It is possible that he thought it was too
obvious to mention. </p>

<h3><a name="5.2">5.2 Zero Isn&apos;t the Successor of Any Number</a></h3>

<p>It is also a simple consequence of the foregoing that 0 doesn&apos;t succeed
any number. This can be represented formally as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Theorem 2</strong>:
<br></br>
 &not;&exist;<em>x</em>(<em>N</em><em>x</em> &amp;amp;
<em>Precedes</em>(<em>x</em>,0))

<p>

<em>Proof</em>: Assume, for <em>reductio</em>, that some object, say
<em>b</em>, is such that <em>Precedes</em>(<em>b</em>,0). Then, by the
definition of predecessor, it follows that there is a concept, say
<em>Q</em> and an object, say <em>c</em>, such that <em>Qc</em> &amp;amp;
0=#<em>Q</em> &amp;amp;
 <em>b</em>=#[&lambda;<em>z</em>&thinsp;<em>Qz</em> &amp;amp; <em>z</em>&ne;<em>c</em>].
 But by the Lemma Concerning Zero (above), 0=#<em>Q</em> implies
&not;&exist;<em>xQx</em>, which contradicts the fact that
<em>Qc</em>. So nothing precedes 0.  Since nothing precedes 0, no
natural number precedes 0.</p> </blockquote>

<p>See <strong>Gl</strong>, &sect;78, Item (6); and <strong>Gg I</strong>,
&sect;109, Theorem 126.</p>

<h3><a name="5.3">5.3 No Two Numbers Have the Same Successor</a></h3>

<p>The fact that no two numbers have the same successor is somewhat more
difficult to prove (cf. <strong>Gl</strong>, &sect;78, Item (5);
<strong>Gg I</strong>, &sect;95, Theorem 89). We may formulate this
theorem as follows, with <em>m</em>, <em>n</em>, and <em>o</em> as
restricted variables ranging over the natural numbers: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Theorem 3</strong>: <br></br>
&forall;<em>m</em>&forall;<em>n</em>&forall;<em>o</em>[<em>Precedes</em>(<em>m</em>,<em>o</em>)
&amp;amp; <em>Precedes</em>(<em>n</em>,<em>o</em>) &rarr; <em>m</em> =
<em>n</em>]</blockquote>

<p>In other words, this theorem asserts that predecessor is a one-to-one
relation on the natural numbers. To prove this theorem, it suffices to
prove that predecessor is a one-to-one relation full stop. One can
prove that predecessor is one-to-one from Hume&apos;s Principle, with the
help of the following Equinumerosity Lemma, the proof of which is
rather long and involved. The Equinumerosity Lemma asserts that when
<em>F</em> and <em>G</em> are equinumerous, <em>x</em> falls under
<em>F</em>, and <em>y</em> falls under <em>G</em>, then the concept
<em>object falling under F other than x</em> is equinumerous to the
concept <em>object falling under G other than y</em>. The picture is
something like this: </p>

<blockquote>
 <img src="equinlem.gif" alt="graphic illustrating Equinumerosity Lemma" width="242" height="160"></img>
<br></br>
 <strong>Figure 3</strong></blockquote>

<p>In terms of Figure 3, the Equinumerosity Lemma tells us that if there
is a relation <em>R</em> which is a witness to the equinumerosity of
<em>F</em> and <em>G</em>, then there is a relation <em>R</em>&prime;
which is a witness to the equinumerosity of the concepts that result
when you restrict <em>F</em> and <em>G</em> to the objects other than
<em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, respectively. </p>

<p>

To help us formalize the Equinumerosity Lemma, let
<em>F</em><sup>&minus;<em>x</em></sup> abbreviate the concept
[&lambda;<em>z</em> <em>Fz</em> &amp;amp; <em>z</em>&ne;<em>x</em>] and let
<em>G</em><sup>&minus;<em>y</em></sup> abbreviate the concept
[&lambda;<em>z</em> <em>Gz</em> &amp;amp; <em>z</em>&ne;<em>y</em>]. Then
we have:</p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Equinumerosity Lemma</strong>:
<br></br>
 <em>F</em> &asymp; <em>G</em> &Scaron;&amp;amp;&Scaron; <em>Fx</em>
&Scaron;&amp;amp;&Scaron; <em>Gy</em> &Scaron; &rarr; &Scaron;
<em>F</em><sup>&minus;<em>x</em></sup> &asymp;
<em>G</em><sup>&minus;<em>y</em></sup>

<p>

 (<a href="proof5.html" name="EqLemProof">Proof of Equinumerosity Lemma</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we can prove that Predecessor is a one-to-one relation from this
Lemma and Hume&apos;s Principle (cf. <strong>Gg I</strong>, &sect;108): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
 <strong>Predecessor is One-to-One</strong>:
<br></br>
 &forall;<em>x</em>&forall;<em>y</em>&forall;<em>z</em>[<em>Precedes</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>z</em>)
 &amp;amp; <em>Precedes</em>(<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>)
&rarr; <em>x</em> = <em>y</em>] </p>

  <p>
  <em>Proof</em>: Assume that both <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are
precedessors of <em>c</em>. By the definition of predecessor, we know
that there are concepts and objects <em>P</em>, <em>Q</em>, <em>d</em>,
and <em>e</em>, such that:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Pd</em> &Scaron;&amp;amp;&Scaron; <em>c</em> = #<em>P</em>
&Scaron;&amp;amp;&Scaron; <em>a</em> = #<em>P</em><sup>&minus;<em>d</em></sup></li>

<li><em>Qe</em> &Scaron;&amp;amp;&Scaron; <em>c</em> = #<em>Q</em>
&Scaron;&amp;amp;&Scaron; <em>b</em> = #<em>Q</em><sup>&minus;<em>e</em></sup></li>
</ul>

  <p>But if both <em>c</em> = #<em>P</em> and <em>c</em> = #<em>Q</em>,
then #<em>P</em> = #<em>Q</em>. So, by Hume&apos;s Principle, <em>P</em>
&asymp; <em>Q</em>. So, by the Equinumerosity Lemma, it follows that
<em>P</em><sup>&minus;<em>d</em></sup> &asymp;
<em>Q</em><sup>&minus;<em>e</em></sup>. If so, then by Hume&apos;s
Principle, #<em>P</em><sup>&minus;<em>d</em></sup> =
#<em>Q</em><sup>&minus;<em>e</em></sup>.  But then, <em>a</em> =
<em>b</em>.</p>
 </blockquote>

<p>So, if Predecessor is a one-to-one relation, it is a one-to-one
relation on the natural numbers. Therefore, no two numbers have the
same successor. This completes the proof of Theorem 3.</p>

<p>

It is important to mention here that not only is Predecessor a
one-to-one relation, it is also a function:</p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Predecessor is a Function</strong>:
<br></br>
 &forall;<em>x</em>&forall;<em>y</em>&forall;<em>z</em>[<em>Precedes</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) &amp;amp; <em>Precedes</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>z</em>)
&rarr; <em>y</em> = <em>z</em>]</blockquote>

<p>This fact can be proved with the help of a kind of converse to the
Equinumerosity Lemma: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Equinumerosity Lemma
&lsquo;Converse&rsquo;</strong>:
<br></br>
 <em>F</em><sup>&minus;<em>x</em></sup> &asymp;
<em>G</em><sup>&minus;<em>y</em></sup> &Scaron;&amp;amp;&Scaron; <em>Fx</em>
&Scaron;&amp;amp;&Scaron; <em>Gy</em> &Scaron; &rarr; &Scaron; <em>F</em> &asymp;
<em>G</em></blockquote>

<p>We leave the proof of the Equinumerosity Lemma &lsquo;Converse&rsquo;
and the proof that Predecessor is a function as exercises for the
reader. The fact that Predecessor is a function will play a part in the
proof that every number has a successor.</p>

<h3><a name="5.4">5.4 The Principle of Mathematical Induction</a></h3>

<p>Let us say that a concept <em>F</em> is <em>hereditary on the natural
numbers</em> just in case every &lsquo;adjacent&rsquo; pair of numbers
<em>n</em> and <em>m</em> (<em>n</em> preceding <em>m</em>) is such
that <em>m</em> falls under <em>F</em> whenever <em>n</em> falls under
<em>F</em>, i.e., </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>HerOn</em>(<em>F</em>,<em>N</em>)
&Scaron;=<sub>abbr</sub>&Scaron;
&forall;<em>n</em>&forall;<em>m</em>[<em>Precedes</em>(<em>n</em>,<em>m</em>)
&rarr; (<em>Fn</em> &rarr; <em>Fm</em>)]</blockquote>

<p>Then we may state the Principle of Mathematical Induction as follows:
if (a) 0 falls under <em>F</em> and (b) <em>F</em> is hereditary on the
natural numbers, then every natural number falls under <em>F</em>. In
formal terms: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Theorem 4</strong>: <strong>Principle of
Mathematical Induction</strong>:
<br></br>
 <em>F</em>0 &amp;amp; <em>HerOn</em>(<em>F</em>,<em>N</em>) &rarr;
&forall;<em>n Fn</em></blockquote>

<p>Frege actually proves the Principle of Mathematical Induction from a
more general principle that governs any <em>R</em>-series whatsoever.
We will call the latter the General Principle of Induction. It asserts
that whenever <em>a</em> falls under <em>F</em>, and <em>F</em> is
hereditary on the <em>R</em>-series beginning with <em>a</em>, then
every member of that <em>R</em>-series falls under <em>F</em>. We can
formalize the General Principle of Induction with the help of a more
strict understanding of &lsquo;hereditary on the <em>R</em>-series
beginning with <em>a</em>&rsquo;. Here is a definition: </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>HerOn</em>(<em>F</em>,
<sup><em>a</em></sup><em>R</em><sup>+</sup>) &Scaron;=<sub>abbr</sub>&Scaron; <br></br>
 &Scaron; &Scaron; &forall;<em>x</em>&forall;<em>y</em>[<em>R</em><sup>+</sup>(<em>a</em>,<em>x</em>)
 &amp;amp; <em>R</em><sup>+</sup>(<em>a</em>,<em>y</em>) &amp;amp;
<em>Rxy</em> &Scaron; &rarr; &Scaron; (<em>Fx</em> &rarr;
<em>Fy</em>)]</blockquote>

<p>In other words, <em>F</em> is hereditary on the members of the
<em>R</em>-series beginning with <em>a</em> just in case every adjacent
pair <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> in this series (with <em>x</em> bearing
<em>R</em> to <em>y</em>) is such that <em>y</em> falls under
<em>F</em> whenever <em>x</em> falls under <em>F</em>. Now given this
definition, we can reformulate the General Principle of Induction more
strictly as: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>General Principle of Induction</strong>:

 [<em>Fa</em> &amp;amp; <em>HerOn</em>(<em>F</em>,
<sup><em>a</em></sup><em>R</em><sup>+</sup>)] &Scaron;&rarr;&Scaron;
&forall;<em>x</em>[<em>R</em><sup>+</sup>(<em>a</em>,<em>x</em>) &rarr;
<em>Fx</em>]</blockquote>

<p>This is a version of Frege&apos;s Theorem 152 in <strong>Gg I</strong>,
&sect;117. </p>

<p>

Frege&apos;s proves this claim by making an insightful appeal to his Rule
of Substitution. We may sketch the proof strategy as follows. Assume
that the antecedent of the General Principle of Induction holds for an
arbitrarily chosen concept, say <em>P</em>. That is, assume:</p>

<blockquote>
 <em>Pa</em> &thinsp;&amp;amp;&thinsp; <em>HerOn</em>(<em>P</em>,
<sup><em>a</em></sup><em>R</em><sup>+</sup>)</blockquote>

<p>Now to show
&forall;<em>x</em>(<em>R</em><sup>+</sup>(<em>a</em>,<em>x</em>) &rarr;
<em>Px</em>), pick an arbitrary object, say <em>b</em>, and further
assume <em>R</em><sup>+</sup>(<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>). We then simply
have to show <em>Pb</em>. Frege does this by using the Rule of
Substitution on Fact (7) about <em>R</em><sup>+</sup> (in our
subsection on the Weak Ancestral in &sect;4). Recall that Fact (7) is: </p>

<blockquote>
 [<em>Fx</em> &amp;amp;
<em>R</em><sup>+</sup>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) &amp;amp;
<em>Her</em>(<em>F</em>,<em>R</em>)] &rarr; <em>Fy</em></blockquote>

<p>This is a theorem of logic containing the free variables <em>x</em>,
<em>y</em>, and <em>F</em>. Frege instantiates <em>x</em> and
<em>y</em> to <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, respectively. He then, as we
might put it, instantiates <em>F</em> to the concept
[&lambda;<em>z</em> <em>R</em><sup>+</sup>(<em>a</em>,<em>z</em>) &amp;amp;
<em>Pz</em>] and applies &lambda;-Conversion. (This is where Frege used
his Rule of Substitution.) The concept being instantiated for
<em>F</em> is the concept <em>member of the R-series beginning with a
and which falls under P</em>. The result of instantiating the free
variables in Fact (7) and then applying &lambda;-Conversion yields a
rather long conditional, with numerous conjuncts in the antecedent and
the claim that <em>Pb</em> in the consequent. Thus, if the antecedent
can be established, the proof is done. However, for those following
along with pencil and paper, all of the conjuncts to this conditional
are things we already know, with the exception of the claim that
[&lambda;<em>z</em> <em>R</em><sup>+</sup>(<em>a</em>,<em>z</em>) &amp;amp;
<em>Pz</em>] is hereditary on <em>R</em>. However, this claim can be
established straightforwardly from things we know to be true (and, in
particular, from facts contained in the antecedent of the Principle we
are trying to prove, which we assumed as part of our conditional
proof). The reader is encouraged to complete the proof as an exercise.
For those who would like to check their work, we give the complete
Proof of the General Principle of Induction here. </p>

<blockquote>
 <a href="proof6.html" name="return-pf6">Proof of the General Principle of Induction</a></blockquote>

<p>

Now to derive Principle of Mathematical Induction from the General
Principle of Induction, we formulate the instance of the latter in
which <em>a</em> is 0 and <em>R</em> is <em>Precedes</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
 [<em>F</em>0 &amp;amp; <em>HerOn</em>(<em>F</em>,
<sup>0</sup><em>Precedes</em><sup>+</sup>)] &Scaron;&rarr;&Scaron;
&forall;<em>x</em>[<em>Precedes</em><sup>+</sup>(0,<em>x</em>) &rarr;
<em>Fx</em>]</blockquote>

<p>When we expand the defined notation for <em>HerOn</em>, substitute the
notation <em>N</em><em>x</em> and <em>N</em><em>y</em> for
<em>Precedes</em><sup>+</sup>(0,<em>x</em>) and
<em>Precedes</em><sup>+</sup>(0,<em>y</em>), respectively, and then
employ our restricted quantifiers
&forall;<em>n</em>(&hellip;<em>n</em>&hellip;) and
&forall;<em>m</em>(&hellip;<em>m</em>&hellip;) for the claims of the
form &forall;<em>y</em>(<em>N</em><em>y</em> &rarr;
&hellip;<em>y</em>&hellip;) and &forall;<em>x</em>(<em>N</em><em>x</em>
&rarr; &hellip;<em>x</em>&hellip;), respectively, the result is the
Principle of Mathematical Induction (in which the notation
<em>HerOn</em>(<em>F</em>,<em>N</em>) has been eliminated in terms of
its definiens). </p>

<h3><a name="5.5">5.5 Every Number Has a Successor</a></h3>

<p>Frege uses the Principle of Mathematical Induction to prove that every
number has a successor in the natural numbers. We may formulate the
theorem as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Theorem 5</strong>:
<br></br>
 &forall;<em>x</em>[<em>N</em><em>x</em> &rarr;
&exist;<em>y</em>(<em>N</em><em>y</em> &amp;amp;
<em>Precedes</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>))]</blockquote>

<p>To understand Frege&apos;s strategy for proving this theorem, recall that
the weak ancestral of the Predecessor relation, i.e.,
<em>Precedes</em><sup>+</sup>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>), can be read as:
<em>x</em> is a member of the predecessor-series ending with
<em>y</em>. Frege then considers the concept <em>member of the
predecessor-series ending with n</em>, i.e., [&lambda;<em>z</em>
<em>Precedes</em><sup>+</sup>(<em>z</em>,<em>n</em>)], where <em>n</em>
is a natural number. Frege then shows, by induction, that every natural
number <em>n</em> precedes the number of the concept <em>member of the
predecessor-series ending with n</em>. That is, Frege proves that every
number has a successor by proving the following Lemma on Successors by
induction: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Lemma on Successors</strong>:
<br></br>
 &forall;<em>n</em> <em>Precedes</em>(<em>n</em>, #[&lambda;<em>z</em>
<em>Precedes</em><sup>+</sup>(<em>z</em>,<em>n</em>)])</blockquote>

<p>This asserts that every number <em>n</em> precedes the number of
numbers in the predecessor series ending with <em>n</em>. Frege can
establish Theorem 5 by proving the Lemma on Successors and by showing
that the successor of a natural number is itself a natural number. </p>

<p>

To see an intuitive picture of why the Lemma on Successors gives us
what we want, we may temporarily regard Precedes<sup>+</sup> as the
relation &le;. (One can prove that Precedes<sup>+</sup> has the
properties that &le; has on the natural numbers.) Although we haven&apos;t
yet defined the natural numbers following 0, the following intuitive
sequence is driving Frege&apos;s strategy:</p>

<blockquote>
 0 precedes #[&lambda;<em>z</em> <em>z</em>&le; 0]
<br></br>
 1 precedes #[&lambda;<em>z</em> <em>z</em>&le; 1]
<br></br>
 2 precedes #[&lambda;<em>z</em> <em>z</em>&le; 2]
<br></br>
 etc.</blockquote>

<p>For example, the third member of this sequence is true because there
are 3 natural numbers (0, 1, and 2) that are less than or equal to 2;
so the number 2 precedes the number of numbers less than or equal to 2.
Frege&apos;s strategy is to show that the general claim, that <em>n</em>
precedes the number of numbers less than or equal to <em>n</em>, holds
for every natural number. So, given this intuitive understanding of the
Lemma on Successors, Frege has a good strategy for proving that every
number has a successor. (For the remainder of this subsection, the
reader may wish to continue to think of Precedes<sup>+</sup> in terms
of &le;.) </p>

<p>

Now to prove the Lemma on Successors by induction, we need to
reconfigure this Lemma to a form which can be used as the consequent of
the Principle of Induction; i.e., we need something of the form
&forall;<em>n Fn</em>. We can get the Lemma on Successors into this
form by &lsquo;abstracting out&rsquo; a concept from the Lemma using
the right-to-left direction of &lambda;-Conversion to produce the
following equivalent statement of the Lemma:</p>

<blockquote>
 &forall;<em>n</em> [&lambda;<em>y</em>
<em>Precedes</em>(<em>y</em>, #[&lambda;<em>z</em>
<em>Precedes</em><sup>+</sup>(<em>z</em>,<em>y</em>)])]<em>n</em></blockquote>

<p>The concept &lsquo;abstracted out&rsquo; is the following: </p>

<blockquote>
 [&lambda;<em>y</em> <em>Precedes</em>(<em>y</em>,
#[&lambda;<em>z</em>
<em>Precedes</em><sup>+</sup>(<em>z</em>,<em>y</em>)])]</blockquote>

<p>This is the concept: <em>being an object y which precedes the number of
the concept: member of the predecessor series ending in y</em>. Let us
abbreviate the &lambda;-expression that denotes this concept as
&lsquo;<em>Q</em>&rsquo;. Then Frege&apos;s strategy is to instantiate the
variable <em>F</em> in the Principle of Induction (using his Rule of
Substitution) to <em>Q</em>. The result is therefore something that we
may take as having been proved: </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>Q</em>0 &amp;amp; <em>HerOn</em>(<em>Q</em>,<em>N</em>)
&rarr; &forall;<em>n Qn</em></blockquote>

<p>Since the consequent is the Lemma on Successors, Frege can prove this
Lemma by proving both that 0 falls under <em>Q</em> (cf. <strong>Gg
I</strong>, Theorem 154) and that <em>Q</em> is hereditary on the
natural numbers (cf. <strong>Gg I</strong>, Theorem 150): </p>

<blockquote>
 <p>
 <a href="Q0.html" name="return-Q0">Proof that 0 falls under <em>Q</em></a></p>

<p>
 <a href="HerOnQN.html" name="return-QN">Proof that <em>Q</em> is hereditary on the natural numbers</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given this proof of the Lemma on Successors, Theorem 5 is not far away.
The Lemma on Successors shows that every number precedes some cardinal
number of the form <em>#F</em>. We still have to show that such
successor cardinals are natural numbers. That is, it still remains to
be shown that if a number <em>n</em> precedes something <em>y</em>,
then <em>y</em> is a natural number: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Successors of Natural Numbers are Natural
Numbers</strong>:
<br></br>
 &forall;<em>n</em>&forall;<em>y</em>(<em>Precedes</em>(<em>n</em>,<em>y</em>)
&rarr; <em>N</em><em>y</em>)

<p>

<em>Proof</em>: Suppose that
<em>Precedes</em>(<em>n</em>,<em>a</em>). Then, by definition, since
<em>n</em> is a natural number,
<em>Precedes</em><sup>+</sup>(0,<em>n</em>). So by Fact (3) about
<em>R</em><sup>+</sup> (in the subsection on the Weak Ancestral in
&sect;4), it follows that <em>Precedes</em>*(0,<em>a</em>), and so by
the definition of <em>Precedes</em><sup>+</sup>, it follows that
<em>Precedes</em><sup>+</sup>(0,<em>a</em>); i.e., <em>a</em> is a
natural number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Theorem 5 now follows from the Lemma on Successors and the fact that
successors of natural numbers are natural numbers. With the proof of
Theorem 5, we have completed the proof of Frege&apos;s Theorem. Before we
turn to the last section of this entry, it is worth mentioning the
mathematical significance of this theorem. </p>

<h3><a name="5.6">5.6 Arithmetic</a></h3>

<p>From Frege&apos;s Theorem, one can derive arithmetic. It is an immediate
consequence of the functionality of Predecessor that every number has a
unique successor. That means we can define the successor function: </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>n</em>&prime; &Scaron;=<sub>df</sub>&Scaron; the <em>x</em>
such that <em>Precedes</em>(<em>n</em>,<em>x</em>)</blockquote>

<p>We may then define the sequence of natural numbers succeeding 0 as
follows: </p>

<blockquote>
 1 = 0&prime;
<br></br>
 2 = 1&prime;
<br></br>
 3 = 2&prime;
<br></br>
 etc.</blockquote>

<p>Moreover, the recursive definition of addition can now be given: </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>n</em> + 0 = <em>n</em>
<br></br>
 <em>n</em> + <em>m</em>&prime; = (<em>n</em> +
<em>m</em>)&prime;</blockquote>

<p>We may also officially define: </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>n</em> &amp;lt; <em>m</em> &Scaron;=<sub>df</sub>&Scaron;
<em>Precedes</em>*(<em>n</em>,<em>m</em>)
<br></br>
 <em>n</em> &le; <em>m</em> &Scaron;=<sub>df</sub>&Scaron;
<em>Precedes</em><sup>+</sup>(<em>n</em>,<em>m</em>)</blockquote>

<p>These definitions constitute the foundations of arithmetic. Frege has
insightfully isolated a group of basic laws in which they may be
grounded.  (Readers interested in how these results are affected when
Hume&apos;s Principle is combined with <em>predicative</em> second-order
logic should consult Linnebo (2004).)</p>

<h2><a name="S6">6. Philosophical Questions Surrounding Frege&apos;s Theorem</a></h2>

<p>Frege&apos;s Theorem is an elegant derivation of the basic laws of
arithmetic which can be carried out independently of the portion of
Frege&apos;s system which led to inconsistency. Frege himself never
identified &ldquo;Frege&apos;s Theorem&rdquo; as a &ldquo;result&rdquo;. In <strong>Gg</strong>, he
attempted to derive Hume&apos;s Principle and the Dedekind-Peano axioms from
Basic Law V, but once the contradiction became known to him, he never
officially retreated to the &lsquo;fall-back&rsquo; position of
claiming that the proof of the Dedekind-Peano axioms from Hume&apos;s
Principle alone constituted an important result. One of several reasons
why he didn&apos;t adopt this fall-back position is that he didn&apos;t regard
Hume&apos;s Principle as a sufficiently general principle &mdash; he didn&apos;t
believe it was strong enough, from an epistemological point of view, to
help us answer the question, &ldquo;How are numbers given to us?&rdquo;. We discuss
the reasons for his attitude, among other things, in what follows.</p>

<p>

A discussion of the philosophical questions surrounding Frege&apos;s
Theorem should begin with some statement of how Frege conceived of his
own project when writing <strong>Begr</strong>, <strong>Gl</strong>,
and <strong>Gg</strong>. It seems clear that epistemological
considerations in part motivated Frege&apos;s work on the foundations of
mathematics. It is well documented that Frege had the following goal,
namely, to explain our knowledge of the basic laws of arithmetic by
giving an answer to the question &ldquo;How are numbers &lsquo;given&rsquo;
to us?&rdquo; which makes no appeal to the faculty of intuition. If Frege
could show that the basic laws of number theory are derivable from
analytic truths of logic, then he could argue that we need only appeal
to the faculty of understanding (as opposed to some faculty of
intuition) to explain our knowledge of the truths of arithmetic.
Frege&apos;s goal then stands in contrast to the Kantian view of the exact
mathematical sciences, according to which general principles of
reasoning must be supplemented by a faculty of intuition if we are to
achieve mathematical knowledge. The Kantian model here is that of
geometry; Kant thought that our intuitions of figures and constructions
played an essential role in the demonstrations of geometrical theorems.
(In Frege&apos;s own time, the achievements of Frege&apos;s contemporaries Pasch,
Pieri and Hilbert showed that such intuitions were not essential.)</p>

<h3><a name="6.1">6.1 Frege&apos;s Goals and Strategy in His Own Words</a></h3>

<p>Frege&apos;s strategy then was to show that no appeal to intuition is
required for the derivation of the theorems of number theory. This in
turn required that he show that the latter are derivable using only
rules of inference, axioms, and definitions that are purely analytic
principles of logic. This view has become known as
&lsquo;Logicism&rsquo;. Here is what Frege says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  [<strong>Begr</strong>, Preface, p. 5:] <br></br>
 To prevent anything intuitive from penetrating here unnoticed, I had
to bend every effort to keep the chain of inferences free of gaps.
[from the Bauer-Mengelberg translation in van Heijenoort (1967)]</p>

  <p>
 [<strong>Begr</strong>, Part III, &sect;23:] <br></br>
 Through the present example, moreover, we see how pure thought,
irrespective of any content given by the senses or even by an intuition
<em>a priori</em>, can, solely from the content that results from its
own constitution, bring forth judgements that at first sight appear to
be possible only on the basis of some
intuition.&Scaron;&hellip;&Scaron;The propositions about sequences
[<em>R</em>-series] in what follows far surpass in generality all
those that can be derived from any intuition of sequences. [from the
Bauer-Mengelberg translation in van Heijenoort (1967)]</p>

  <p>
 [<strong>Gl</strong>, &sect;62:] <br></br>
 How, then, are numbers to be given to us, if we cannot have any ideas
or intuitions of them? Since it is only in the context of a proposition
that words have any meaning, our problem becomes this: To define the
sense of a proposition in which a number word occurs.
[from the Austin translation in Frege (1974)]</p>

  <p>
 [<strong>Gl</strong>, &sect;87:] <br></br>
 I hope I may claim in the present work to have made it probable that
the laws of arithmetic are analytic judgements and consequently a
priori. Arithmetic thus becomes simply a development of logic, and
every proposition of arithmetic a law of logic, albeit a derivative
one. [from the Austin translation in Frege (1974)]</p>

  <p>
 [<strong>Gg I</strong>, &sect;0:] <br></br>
 In my <em>Grundlagen der Arithmetik</em>, I sought to make it
plausible that arithmetic is a branch of logic and need not borrow any
ground of proof whatever from either experience or intuition. In the
present book, this shall be confirmed, by the derivation of the
simplest laws of Numbers by logical means alone.
[from the Furth translation in Frege (1967)]</p>

  <p>
 [<strong>Gg II</strong>, Appendix:] <br></br>
 The prime problem of arithmetic is the question, In what way are we to
conceive logical objects, in particular, numbers? By what means are we
justified in recognizing numbers as objects? Even if this problem is
not solved to the degree I thought it was when I wrote this volume,
still I do not doubt that the way to the solution has been found.
[from the Furth translation in Frege (1967)]</p>

</blockquote>

<h3><a name="6.2">6.2 The Basic Problem for Frege&apos;s Strategy</a></h3>

<p>The basic problem for Frege&apos;s strategy, however, is that for his
logicist project to succeed, his system must at some point include
(either as an axiom or theorem) statements that explicitly assert the
existence of certain kinds of abstract entities and it is not obvious
how to justify the claim that we know such explicit existential
statements. Given our description of his system, it should be clear
that Frege&apos;s logical system includes existence claims for the following
entities: </p>

<ul>
<li>concepts (more generally, functions)</li>

<li>extensions (more generally, courses-of-value or value-ranges)</li>

<li>truth-values</li>

<li>numbers</li>
</ul>

<p>

Although Frege attempted to reduce the latter two kinds of entities
(truth-values and numbers) to extensions, the fact is that the
existence of concepts and extensions are implied by his Rule of
Substitution and Basic Law V, respectively. Logic, it is often argued,
should be free of such existence assumptions. A Kantian might well
complain both that explicit existence claims seem to be synthetic
rather than analytic (i.e., such claims don&apos;t seem to be true in virtue
of the meanings of the words involved) and that since the Rule of
Substitution and Basic Law V imply existence claims, Frege cannot claim
that such principles are purely analytic principles of logic. If so,
then some other faculty (such as intuition) might still be needed to
account for our knowledge of (the existence claims of) arithmetic. </p>

<h3><a name="6.3">6.3 The Existence of Concepts</a></h3>

<p>Boolos (1985) was the first to note that the Rule of Substitution
causes a problem of this kind for Frege&apos;s program, since it is
equivalent to a quite liberal existential claim, namely, the
Comprehension Principle for Concepts. Boolos suggests a defense for
Frege with respect to this particular aspect of his logic, namely, to
reinterpret (by paraphrasing) the second-order quantifiers so as to
avoid commitment to concepts. (See Boolos (1985) for the details.)
Boolos&apos;s suggestion, however, is one which would require Frege to
abandon his realist theory of concepts. Moreover, although Boolos&apos;
suggestion might lead us to an epistemological justification of the
Comprehension Principle for Concepts, it doesn&apos;t do the same for the
Comprehension Principle for Relations, for his reinterpretation of the
quantifiers works only for the &lsquo;monadic&rsquo; quantifiers (i.e.,
those ranging over concepts having one argument) and thus doesn&apos;t offer
a paraphrase for quantification over relational concepts. </p>

<p>

Another problem for a strategy of the type suggested by Boolos is
that if the second-order quantifiers are interpreted so that they do
not range over a separate domain of entities, then there is nothing
appropriate to serve as the denotations of &lambda;-expressions.
Although Frege wouldn&apos;t quite put it this way, we have seen that his
system treats open formulas with free object variables as if they
denoted concepts. Although Frege doesn&apos;t use &lambda;-notation, the use
of such notation seems to be the most logically perspicuous way of
reconstructing his work. The use of such notation faces the same
epistemological puzzles that Frege&apos;s Rule of Substitution faces.</p>

<p>

To see why, note that the Principle of &lambda;-Conversion:</p>

<blockquote>
 &forall;<em>y</em>([&lambda;<em>x</em>
&phi;(<em>x</em>)]<em>y</em> &equiv;
&phi;(<em>y</em>/<em>x</em>))</blockquote>

<p>seems to be an analytic truth of logic. It says this: </p>

<blockquote>
 An object <em>y</em> exemplifies the complex property
<em>being an x such that</em> &phi;(<em>x</em>) if and only if
<em>y</em> is an <em>x</em> such that &phi;</blockquote>

<p>One might argue that this is true in virtue of the very meaning of the
&lambda;-expression, the meaning of &equiv;, and the meaning of the
statement form <em>Fx</em>. However, &lambda;-Conversion also implies
the Comprehension Principle for Concepts, for the latter follows from
the former by existential generalization: </p>

<blockquote>
 &exist;<em>F</em>&forall;<em>y</em>(<em>Fy</em> &equiv;
&phi;(<em>y</em>/<em>x</em>))</blockquote>

<p>The point here is that the fact that an existential claim is derivable
casts at least some doubt on the purely analytic status of
&lambda;-Conversion. The question of how we obtain knowledge of such
principles is still an open question in philosophy. It is an important
question to address, since Frege&apos;s most insightful definitions are cast
using quantifiers ranging over concepts and relations (e.g., the
ancestrals of a relation) and it would be useful to have a
philosophical explanation of how such entities and the principles which
govern them become known to us. In contemporary philosophy, this
question is still poignant, since many philosophers do accept that
<em>properties</em> and <em>relations</em> of various sorts exist.
These entities are the contemporary analogues of Frege&apos;s concepts. </p>

<h3><a name="6.4">6.4 The Existence of Extensions</a></h3>

<p>Though the existence of extensions falls right out of the theory of
identity (&sect;2.3), the existence of extensions that are correlated
1&ndash;1 with concepts is a consequence of Basic Law V. The question
for Frege&apos;s project, then, is why should we accept as a law of logic a
statement that implies the existence of individuals and a a
correlation of this kind?  Frege recognized that Basic Law V could be
doubted but held it was a law of logic: </p>

<blockquote>
 [<strong>Gg I</strong>, Preface, p. 3:] <br></br>
 A dispute can arise, so far as I can see, only with regard to my Basic
Law concerning courses-of-values (V)&hellip; I hold that it is a law of
pure logic. [from the Furth translation in Frege (1967)]</blockquote>

<p>Moreover, he thought that an appeal to extensions would answer one of
the questions that motivated his work: </p>

<blockquote>
 [<strong>Letter to Russell</strong>, July 28, 1902:] <br></br> I myself
 was long reluctant to recognize ranges of values and hence classes
 [sets]; but I saw no other possibility of placing arithmetic on a
 logical foundation. But the question is, How do we apprehend logical
 objects? And I have found no other answer to it than this, We
 apprehend them as extensions of concepts, or more generally, as
 ranges of values of functions. [from the Kaal translation in Frege
 (1980)]</blockquote>

<p>Now it is unclear why Frege thought that he could answer the question
posed here with the reply &ldquo;We apprehend numbers as extensions of
concepts&rdquo;. He seems to think we can answer the obvious next question
&ldquo;How do we apprehend extensions?&rdquo; by saying &ldquo;by way of Basic Law V&rdquo;.

His idea here seems to be that since Basic Law V is supposed to be
purely analytic or true in virtue of the meanings of its terms, we
apprehend a pair of extensions whenever we truly judge that concepts
<em>F</em> and <em>G</em> are materially equivalent. Some philosophers
argue that Frege would have been correct to argue in just this way (had
Basic Law V been consistent). They argue that Basic Law V (or
consistent principles having the same logical form) justifies
<em>reference</em> to the entities described in the left-side condition
by grounding such reference in the <em>truth</em> of the right-side
 condition.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#12" name="note-12">12</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

But this, of course, raises an obvious problem. To justify reference
to extensions, we must first justify the claim that those extensions
exist. It is not clear that the claim that concepts are materially
equivalent can justify such an existence claim. But given Frege&apos;s view
that Basic Law V is analytic, it seems that he must hold that the
right-side condition implies the corresponding left-side condition as a
matter of
 meaning.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#13" name="note-13">13</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

This view, however, runs up against the following argument. Suppose
the right hand condition implies the left-side condition as a matter of
meaning. That is, suppose that (R) implies (L) as a matter of
meaning:</p>

<blockquote>
 (R) &Scaron; &forall;<em>x</em>(<em>Fx</em> &equiv;
<em>Gx</em>)

<p>

(L) &Scaron; &epsilon;<em>F</em> = &epsilon;<em>G</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now note that (L) itself can be analyzed, from a logical point of
view.  The expression &lsquo;&epsilon;<em>F</em>&rsquo;, though
constructed from a term-forming operator, is really a definite
description (&lsquo;the extension of <em>F</em>&rsquo;) and so, using
Russell&apos;s theory of descriptions, (L) can be logically analyzed as the
claim: </p>

<blockquote>
 There is an object <em>x</em> and an object <em>y</em> such
that:
<br></br>
 &Scaron;&Scaron;&Scaron; (1) <em>x</em> is a unique extension of <em>F</em>,
<br></br>
 &Scaron;&Scaron;&Scaron; (2) <em>y</em> is a unique extension of <em>G</em>,
and
<br></br>
 &Scaron;&Scaron;&Scaron; (3) <em>x</em> = <em>y</em>.</blockquote>

<p>That is, for some defined or primitive notion
<em>Extension</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>F</em>) (&lsquo;<em>x</em> is an
extension of <em>F</em>&rsquo;), (L) implies the analysis (D) as a
matter of meaning: </p>

<blockquote>
 (D) &Scaron;
&exist;<em>x</em>&exist;<em>y</em>[<em>Extension</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>F</em>)
&amp;amp; &forall;<em>z</em>(<em>Extension</em>(<em>z</em>,<em>F</em>)
&rarr; <em>z</em>=<em>x</em>) &amp;amp;
<br></br>
 &Scaron; &Scaron; &Scaron; &Scaron; &Scaron;
<em>Extension</em>(<em>y</em>,<em>G</em>) &amp;amp;
&forall;<em>z</em>(<em>Extension</em>(<em>z</em>,<em>G</em>) &rarr;
<em>z</em>=<em>y</em>) &thinsp;&amp;amp;&thinsp;
<em>x</em> = <em>y</em>]</blockquote>

<p>But if (R) implies (L) as a matter of meaning, and (L) implies (D) as a
matter of meaning, then (R) implies (D) as a matter of meaning. This
seems doubtful. The material equivalence of <em>F</em> and <em>G</em>
does not imply the existence claim (D) as a matter of meaning, whatever
notion of meaning is involved. [This argument attempts to show why Va
(i.e., the right-to-left direction of Basic Law V) is not analytic.
Below, it will be adapted to show that the right-to-left direction of
Hume&apos;s Principle is not analytic. See Boolos (1997, 307&ndash;309), for
reasons why Vb and the left-to-right direction of Hume&apos;s Principle are
not analytic.] </p>

<p>

The moral to be drawn here is that the modern Fregean must attempt
to explain our knowledge of existence claims for abstract objects such
as extensions <em>head on</em>, and not try to justify them indirectly,
by attempting to justify claims that imply such existence claims. Even
if we follow Frege in conceiving of extensions as &lsquo;logical
objects&rsquo;, the question remains as to how the very claims that
such objects exist can be true on logical or analytic grounds alone. We
might agree that there must be logical objects of some sort if logic is
to have a subject matter, but if Frege is to achieve his goal of
showing that our knowledge of arithmetic is free of intuition, then the
logical knowledge with which he identifies arithmetical knowledge must
be either be <em>purely</em> analytic or shown otherwise to be free of
intuition. We&apos;ll return to this theme in the final subsection.</p>

<h3><a name="6.5">6.5 The Existence of Numbers and Truth-Values: The Julius Caesar Problem</a></h3>

<p>Given that the proof of Frege&apos;s Theorem makes no appeal to Basic Law V,
some philosophers have argued Frege&apos;s best strategy for achieving his
goal is to replace Basic Law V with Hume&apos;s Principle and argue that
Hume&apos;s Principle is an analytic principle of
 logic.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#14" name="note-14">14</a>]</sup>
 However, we have just seen one reason why such a strategy does not
suffice. The claim that Hume&apos;s Principle is an analytic principle of
logic is subject to the same problem just posed for Basic Law V. The
equinumerosity of <em>F</em> and <em>G</em> does not, as a matter of
meaning, imply (identity claims that entail) the existence of
numbers. When we analyze &ldquo;#<em>F</em> = #<em>G</em>&rdquo; in the same way
that we analyzed &ldquo;&epsilon;<em>F</em> = &epsilon;<em>G</em>&rdquo; (i.e., by
analyzing away the operator # or definite description &ldquo;the number of
<em>F</em>s&rdquo; in terms of existence and uniqueness claims), it becomes
clear that the equinumerosity of <em>F</em> and <em>G</em> does not,
as a matter of meaning, imply the result of the analysis.</p>

<p>

Moreover, Frege had his own reasons for not replacing Basic Law V
with Hume&apos;s Principle. One reason was that he thought Hume&apos;s Principle
offered no answer to the epistemological question, &lsquo;How do we
grasp or apprehend logical objects, such as the numbers?&rsquo;. But
Frege had another reason for not substituting Hume&apos;s Principle for
Basic Law V, namely, that Hume&apos;s Principle would be subject to
&lsquo;the Julius Caesar problem&rsquo;. Frege first raises this
problem in connection with an inductive definition of &lsquo;<em>n</em>
= #<em>F</em>&rsquo; that he tries out in <strong>Gl</strong>,
&sect;55. Concerning this definition, Frege says:</p>

<blockquote>
 [<strong>Gl</strong>, &sect;55:] <br></br>
&Scaron;&hellip;&Scaron;but we can never &mdash; to take a crude example
&mdash; decide by means of our definitions whether any concept has the
number Julius Caesar belonging to it, or whether that conqueror of Gaul
is a number or is not. [from the Austin translation in
Frege (1974)]</blockquote>

<p>Frege raises this same concern again for a contextual definition that
gives a &lsquo;criterion of identity&rsquo; for the objects being
defined. In <strong>Gl</strong> &sect;66, Frege considers the following
contextual definition of &lsquo;the direction of line
<em>x</em>&rsquo;: </p>

<blockquote>
 The direction of line <em>a</em> = the direction of line
<em>b</em> if and only if <em>a</em> is parallel to
<em>b</em>.</blockquote>

<p>With regard to this definition, Frege says: </p>

<blockquote>
 [<strong>Gl</strong>, &sect;66:] <br></br>
 It will not, for instance, decide for us whether England is the same
as the direction of the Earth&apos;s axis&mdash; if I may be forgiven an
example which looks nonsensical. Naturally no one is going to confuse
England with the direction of the Earth&apos;s axis; but that is no thanks
to our definition of direction.
[from the Austin translation in Frege (1974)]</blockquote>

<p>Now trouble for Hume&apos;s Principle begins to arise when we recognize that
it is a contextual definition that has the same logical form as this
definition for directions. It is central to Frege&apos;s view that the
numbers are <em>objects</em>, and so he believes that it is incumbent
upon him to say <em>which</em> objects they are. But the &lsquo;Julius
Caesar problem&rsquo; is that Hume&apos;s Principle, if considered as the
sole principle offering identity conditions for numbers, doesn&apos;t
describe the conditions under which an arbitrary object, say Julius
Caesar, is or is not to be identified with the number of planets. That
is, Hume&apos;s Principle doesn&apos;t define the condition
&lsquo;#<em>F</em>=<em>x</em>&rsquo;, for arbitrary <em>x</em>. It only
offers identity conditions when <em>x</em> is an object we know to be a
cardinal number (for then <em>x</em>=#<em>G</em>, for some <em>G</em>,
and Hume&apos;s Principle tells us when #<em>F</em>=#<em>G</em>).</p>

<p>

In <strong>Gl</strong>, Frege solves the problem by giving his
explicit definition of numbers in terms of extensions. (We described
this in &sect;4 above.) Unfortunately, this is only a stopgap measure,
for when Frege later systematizes extensions in <strong>Gg</strong>,
Basic Law V has the same logical form as Hume&apos;s Principle and the above
contextual definition of directions. Frege is aware that the Julius
Caesar problem affects Basic Law V, though. In <strong>Gg I</strong>,
&sect;10, Frege appears to raise the Julius Caesar problem for
extensions of concepts. With respect to Basic Law V, he says
(remembering that for Frege, &epsilon; binds object variables and not
concept variables):</p>

<blockquote>
 [<strong>Gg I</strong>, &sect;10:] <br></br>
 &hellip;this by no means fixes completely the denotation of a name
like &lsquo;ἐ&Phi;(&epsilon;)&rsquo;. We have only a
means of always recognizing a course-of-values if it is designated by a
name like &lsquo;ἐ&Phi;(&epsilon;)&rsquo;, by which it is
already recognizable as a course-of-values. But, we can neither decide,
so far, whether an object is a course-of-values that is not given us as
such &hellip; [from the Furth translation in Frege (1967)]</blockquote>

<p>In other words, Basic Law V does not tell us the conditions under which
an arbitrarily chosen object <em>x</em> may be identified with some
given extension, such as &epsilon;<em>F</em>. </p>

<p>

Until recently, it was thought that Frege solved this problem in
&sect;10 by restricting the universal quantifier &forall;<em>x</em> of
his <strong>Gg</strong> system so that it ranges only over extensions.
If Frege could have successfully restricted this quantifier to
extensions, then when the question arises, whether (arbitrarily chosen)
object <em>x</em> is identical with &epsilon;<em>F</em>, one could
answer that <em>x</em> has to be the extension of some concept, say
<em>G</em> and that Basic Law V would then tell you the conditions
under which <em>x</em> is identical to &epsilon;<em>F</em>. On this
interpretation of &sect;10, Frege is alleged to have restricted the
quantifiers when he identified the two truth values (The True and The
False) with the two extensions that contain just these objects as
members, respectively. By doing this, it was thought that all of the
objects in the range of his quantifier &forall;<em>x</em> in
<strong>Gg</strong> become extensions which have been identified as
such, for the truth values were the only two objects of his system that
had not been introduced as extensions or courses of value.</p>

<p>

However, recent work by Wehmeier (1999) suggests that, in &sect;10,
Frege was not attempting to restrict the quantifiers of his system to
extensions (nor, more generally, to courses-of-values). The extensive
footnote to &sect;10 indicates that Frege considered, but did not hold
much hope of, identifying every object in the domain with the extension
consisting of just that
 object.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#15" name="note-15">15</a>]</sup>
 But, more importantly, Frege later considers cases (in
<strong>Gg</strong>, Sections 34 and 35) which seem to presuppose that
the domain contains objects which aren&apos;t extensions.  (In these
sections, Frege considers what happens to the definition of
&lsquo;<em>x</em> is a member of <em>y</em>&rsquo; when <em>y</em> is
not an
 extension.)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#16" name="note-16">16</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Even if Frege somehow could have successfully restricted the
quantifiers of <strong>Gg</strong> to avoid the Julius Caesar problem,
he would no longer have been able to extend his system to include names
of ordinary non-logical objects. For if he were to attempt to do so,
the question, &ldquo;Under what conditions is &epsilon;<em>F</em> identical
with Julius Caesar?&rdquo;, would then be legitimate but have no answer. That
means his logical system could not be used for the analysis of ordinary
language. But it was just the analysis of ordinary language that led
Frege to his insight that a statement of number is an assertion about a
concept.</p>

<h3><a name="6.6">6.6 Final Observations</a></h3>

<p>Even when we replace the inconsistent Basic Law V with the powerful
Hume&apos;s Principle, Frege&apos;s work still leaves two questions unanswered:
(1) How do we know that numbers exist?, and (2) How do we precisely
specify which objects they are? The first question arises because
Hume&apos;s Principle doesn&apos;t seem to be a purely analytic truth of logic;
if neither Hume&apos;s Principle nor the existential claim that numbers
exist is analytically true, by what faculty do we come to know (the
truth of) the existential claim? The second question arises because
Frege&apos;s work offers no general condition under which we can identify
an arbitrarily chosen object <em>x</em> with a given number such as
the number of planets; how then can Frege claim to have precisely
specified which objects the numbers are within the domain of all
logical and non-logical objects? So questions about the very existence
and identity of numbers still plague Frege&apos;s work.</p>

<p>

These two questions arise because of a limitation in the logical form
of these Fregean biconditional principles such as Hume&apos;s Principle and
Basic Law V. These contextual definitions combine two jobs which
modern logicians now typically accomplish with separate principles. A
properly reformulated theory of &lsquo;logical&rsquo; objects should
have separate principles: (1) a comprehension principle which asserts
the existence of <em>logical objects</em>, and (2) an identity
principle which asserts the conditions under which <em>logical
objects</em> are identical. The latter should specify identity
conditions for logical objects in terms of their most salient
characteristic, one which distinguishes them from other objects. Such
an identity principle would then be more specific than the global
identity principle for all objects (Leibniz&apos;s Law) which asserts that
if objects <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> fall under the same concepts,
they are identical.</p>

<p>

By way of example, consider modern set theory. Zermelo set theory (Z)
has a distinctive comprehension principle for sets:</p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Subset Axiom of Z</strong>:
<br></br>
 &forall;<em>x</em>[<em>Set</em>(<em>x</em>) &rarr;
&exist;<em>y</em>[<em>Set</em>(<em>y</em>) &amp;amp;
&forall;<em>z</em>(<em>z</em> &isin; <em>y</em> &equiv; <em>z</em>
&isin; <em>x</em> &amp;amp; &phi;(<em>z</em>))]],
<br></br>
 where &phi;(<em>z</em>) is any formula in which the variable
<em>z</em> is free and which has no free variables
<em>y</em></blockquote>

<p>Z has a separate identity principle: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Identity Principle for Sets</strong>:
<br></br>
 <em>Set</em>(<em>x</em>) &amp;amp; <em>Set</em>(<em>y</em>) &rarr;
[&forall;<em>z</em>(<em>z</em> &isin; <em>x</em> &equiv; <em>z</em>
&isin; <em>y</em>) &rarr; <em>x</em> = <em>y</em>]</blockquote>

<p>Note that the second principle offers identity conditions in terms of
the most salient features of sets, namely, the fact that they, unlike
other objects, have members. The identity conditions for objects which
<em>aren&apos;t</em> sets, then, can be the standard principle that
identifies objects whenever they fall under the same concepts. This
leads us naturally to a very general principle of identity for any
objects whatever: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>General Principle of Identity</strong>:
<br></br>
 <em>x</em> = <em>y</em> &Scaron; =<sub>df</sub> &Scaron;
[<em>Set</em>(<em>x</em>) &amp;amp; <em>Set</em>(<em>y</em>) &amp;amp;
&forall;<em>z</em>(<em>z</em> &isin; <em>x</em> &equiv; <em>z</em>
&isin; <em>y</em>)] &Scaron; &or;
<br></br>
 &Scaron; &Scaron; &Scaron; &Scaron; &Scaron; &Scaron; &Scaron; &Scaron; &Scaron; &Scaron;
&Scaron; [&not;<em>Set</em>(<em>x</em>) &amp;amp;
&not;<em>Set</em>(<em>y</em>) &amp;amp; &forall;<em>F</em>(<em>Fx</em>
&equiv; <em>Fy</em>)]</blockquote>

<p>Now, if something is given to us <em>as a set</em> and we ask whether
it is identical with an arbitrarily chosen object <em>x</em>, this
specifies a clear condition that settles the matter. The only questions
that remain for the theory Z concern its existence principle: Do we
know that the comprehension principle is true, and if so, how? The
question of existence is thus laid bare. We do not approach it by
attempting to justify a principle that implies the existence of sets
via definite descriptions which we don&apos;t yet know to be well-defined.</p>

<p>

In his classic essays (1987) and (1986), Boolos appears to recommend
this very procedure of using separate existence and identity
principles. In those essays, he eschews the primitive mathematical
relation of set membership and suggests that Frege formulate his theory
of numbers (&lsquo;Frege Arithmetic&rsquo;) by using a single
<em>nonlogical</em> comprehension axiom which employs a special
instantiation relation that holds between a concept <em>G</em> and an
object <em>x</em> whenever, intuitively, <em>x</em> is an extension
consisting solely of concepts and <em>G</em> is a concept
&lsquo;in&rsquo; <em>x</em>. He calls this nonlogical axiom
&lsquo;Numbers&rsquo; and uses the notation
&lsquo;<em>G</em>&eta;<em>x</em>&rsquo; to signify that <em>G</em> is
in <em>x</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Numbers</strong>:
<br></br>
 &forall;<em>F</em>&exist;!<em>x</em>&forall;<em>G</em>(<em>G</em>&eta;<em>
x</em> &equiv; <em>G</em>&asymp;<em>F</em>)</blockquote>

<p>[See Boolos (1987), p. 5; and (1986), p. 140.] This principle asserts
that for any concept <em>F</em>, there is a unique object which
contains in it all and only those concepts <em>G</em> which are
equinumerous to <em>F</em>. Boolos then makes two observations: (1)
that Frege can then define #<em>F</em> as &ldquo;the unique object <em>x</em>
such that for all concepts <em>G</em>, <em>G</em> is in <em>x</em> iff
<em>G</em> is equinumerous to <em>F</em>&rdquo;, and (2) that Hume&apos;s
Principle is derivable from Numbers. [See Boolos (1986), p. 140.] Given
these observations, we know from our work in &sect;&sect;4 and 5 above
that Numbers suffices for the derivation of the basic laws of
arithmetic.</p>

<p>

Since Boolos calls this principle &lsquo;Numbers&rsquo;, it is no
stretch to suppose that he would accept the following
reformulation (in which &lsquo;<em>Number</em>(<em>x</em>)&rsquo; is an
undefined, primitive notion):</p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Numbers</strong>:
<br></br>
 &forall;<em>F</em>&exist;!<em>x</em>[<em>Number</em>(<em>x</em>) &amp;amp;
&forall;<em>G</em>(<em>G</em>&eta;<em>x</em> &equiv;
<em>G</em>&asymp;<em>F</em>)]</blockquote>

<p>Though Boolos doesn&apos;t explicitly formulate an identity principle to
complement Numbers, it seems clear that the following principle would
offer identity conditions in terms of the most distinctive feature of
numbers: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Identity Principle for Numbers</strong>:
<br></br>
 <em>Number</em>(<em>x</em>) &amp;amp; <em>Number</em>(<em>y</em>) &rarr;
[&forall;<em>G</em>(<em>G</em>&eta;<em>x</em> &equiv;
<em>G</em>&eta;<em>y</em>) &rarr; <em>x</em> = <em>y</em>]</blockquote>

<p>It is then straightforward to formulate a general principle of
identity, as we did in the case of the set theory Z: </p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>General Principle of Identity</strong>:
<br></br>
 <em>x</em> = <em>y</em> &Scaron; =<sub>df</sub> &Scaron;
[<em>Number</em>(<em>x</em>) &amp;amp; <em>Number</em>(<em>y</em>) &amp;amp;
&forall;<em>F</em>(<em>F</em>&eta;<em>x</em> &equiv;
<em>F</em>&eta;<em>y</em>)] &Scaron; &or;
<br></br>
 &Scaron; &Scaron; &Scaron; &Scaron; &Scaron; &Scaron; &Scaron; &Scaron; &Scaron; &Scaron;
[&not;<em>Number</em>(<em>x</em>) &amp;amp;
&not;<em>Number</em>(<em>y</em>) &amp;amp; &forall;<em>F</em>(<em>Fx</em>
&equiv; <em>Fy</em>)]</blockquote>

<p>This formulation of Frege Arithmetic, in terms of Numbers and the
General Principle of Identity, puts the Julius Caesar problem
(described above) into better perspective; the condition
&lsquo;#<em>F</em>=<em>x</em>&rsquo; is defined for arbitrary concepts
<em>F</em> and objects <em>x</em>. It openly faces the epistemological
questions head-on: Do we know that Numbers is true, and if so, how?
This is where philosophers need to concentrate their energies. [For a
reconstruction of Frege Arithmetic with a more general version of the
special instantiation relation &eta;, see Zalta (1999).] </p>

<p>

By replacing Fregean biconditionals such as Hume&apos;s Principle with
separate existence and identity principles, we reduce two problems to
one and and isolate the real problem for Fregean foundations of
arithmetic, namely, the problem of giving an epistemological
justification of distinctive existence claims (e.g., Numbers) for
abstract objects of a certain kind. For anything like Frege&apos;s program
to succeed, it must at some point assert (as an axiom or theorem) the
existence of (logical) objects of some kind. Those separate existence
claims should be the focus of attention, for they are the point at
which logic and metaphysics dovetail. The theory of logical objects,
if carried out without any mathematical primitives, might in fact be
best understood as a theory where logic and metaphysics dovetail.  A
proper epistemology for such a theory should offer some
epistemological justification of the separate existence claims that
are theorems of that theory. That is a moral that could be drawn
from Frege&apos;s work.</p>

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>

I was motivated to write the present entry after reading an early
draft of an essay by William Demopoulos. (The draft was eventually
published as Demopoulos and Clark 2005.) Demopoulos kindly allowed me
to quote certain passages from that early draft in the footnotes to
the present entry. I am also indebted to Roberto Torretti, who
carefully read this piece and identified numerous infelicities; to
Franz Fritsche, who noticed a quantifier transposition error in Fact 2
about the strong ancestral, to Seyed N. Mousavian, who noticed some
typographical errors in some formulas; to Xu Mingming, who noticed
that Fact 8 about the Weak Ancestral (Section 4, subsection &ldquo;The Weak
Ancestral of <em>R</em>&rdquo;) was missing an important condition (namely,
that <em>R</em> must be 1&ndash;1); and to Paul Pietroski, who noticed an
infelicity in the first statement of the principle of induction in
Section 4. I am indebted to Kai Wehmeier, who reminded me
that, strictly speaking, the result of replacing Basic Law V by Hume&apos;s
Principle in Frege&apos;s system does not result in a subsystem of the
original until we replace the primitive notion &ldquo;the course of values
of the function &fnof;&rdquo; with the primitive notion &ldquo;the number of
<em>F</em>s&rdquo;. Finally, I am indebted to Jerzy Hanusek for
pointing out that Existence of Extensions principle can be derived
more simply in Frege&apos;s system directly from the classical logic of
identity. </p>
