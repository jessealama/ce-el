<h1>Gottlob Frege</h1>

<h2>en-dash test</h2>

<p>
The lines in the list below should look like<br />
Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege (1848&ndash;1925) was a German</p>

<ul>

<li>
Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege (1848 - 1925) was a German</li>

<li>
Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege (1848-1925) was a German</li>

<li>
Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege (1848 &ndash; 1925) was a German</li>

<li>
Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege (1848&ndash;1925) was a German</li>

<li>
Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege (1848 &mdash; 1925) was a German</li>

<li>
Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege (1848&mdash;1925) was a German</li>

</ul>


<p>This paragraph includes some more complex dashes that should be
en-dashes.  In particular, some ranges: i-iii, I-IV, and XLV-LVI.
Other ranges are mixed, such as 234a-235b.  Finally, some ranges use
parentheses, such as (1)-(4), (i)-(v), and even letter-denoted ranges
such as (a)-(d).  These should all use en-dashes.</p>




<h2>em-dash test</h2>

<p>
The lines in the list below should look like<br />
mathematician, logician, and philosopher&mdash;who worked at the University
</p>

<ul>

<li>
mathematician, logician, and philosopher - who worked at the University</li>
<li>
mathematician, logician, and philosopher -- who worked at the University</li>

<li>
mathematician, logician, and philosopher--who worked at the University</li>

<li>
mathematician, logician, and philosopher---who worked at the University</li>

<li>
mathematician, logician, and philosopher &ndash; who worked at the University</li>

<li>
mathematician, logician, and philosopher&ndash;who worked at the University</li>

<li>
mathematician, logician, and philosopher &mdash; who worked at the University</li>

<li>
mathematician, logician, and philosopher&mdash;who worked at the University</li>

</ul>

<p>
Another type of em-dash to test is in the context of a paragraph.  In
particular, there are cases with em-dashes set at the end of a line &mdash;
in which case there is a hard return.  The em-dashes can also occur at
the beginning of a line as in the following sentence.  Here is a sentence
&mdash; and there is the em-dash at the beginning of the line.

The above paragraph should look something like this.</p>

<p>(I'm not sure whether this should wait until a general line
un-wrapping and re-wrapping function.)</p>
